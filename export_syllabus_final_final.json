To address these public health crises, we urgently need to explore innovative strategies for promoting healthful eating. There is strong evidence that global increases in the consumption of heavily processed foods, coupled with cultural shifts away from the preparation of food in the home, have contributed to high rates of preventable, chronic disease. In this course, learners will be given the information and practical skills they need to begin optimizing the way they eat. This course will shift the focus away from reductionist discussions about nutrients and move, instead, towards practical discussions about real food and the environment in which we consume it. By the end of this course, learners should have the tools they need to distinguish between foods that will support their health and those that threaten it.

To do that, we begin by laying a foundation for negotiation, a theory of the \u201cpie.\u201d Over the years, I\u2019ve discovered even the most experienced negotiators tend to lack a framework that grounds their approach to negotiation. While some folks try to bully their way to a larger share, most people make arguments that sound fair to them. But what sounds fair to them often doesn\u2019t sound fair to the other side. Their criteria for what's fair may be biased in their favor. The theory of the pie is useful because it doesn\u2019t depend on which side you are taking.

We consider clinical trials experiments because the investigators rather than the patients or their doctors select the treatment the patients receive. Results from randomized clinical trials are usually considered the highest level of evidence for determining whether a treatment is effective because trials incorporates features to ensure that evaluation of the benefits and risks of treatments are objective and unbiased. The FDA requires that drugs or biologics (e.g., vaccines) are shown to be effective in clinical trials before they can be sold in the US.The course will explain the basic principles for design of randomized clinical trials and how they should be reported.

In this course, you will discover the organization of the neural systems in the brain and spinal cord that mediate sensation, motivate bodily action, and integrate sensorimotor signals with memory, emotion and related faculties of cognition. The overall goal of this course is to provide the foundation for understanding the impairments of sensation, action and cognition that accompany injury, disease or dysfunction in the central nervous system. The course will build upon knowledge acquired through prior studies of cell and molecular biology, general physiology and human anatomy, as we focus primarily on the central nervous system.This online course is designed to include all of the core concepts in neurophysiology and clinical neuroanatomy that would be presented in most first-year neuroscience courses in schools of medicine. However, there are some topics (e.g., biological psychiatry) and several learning experiences (e.g., hands-on brain dissection) that we provide in the corresponding course offered in the Duke University School of Medicine on campus that we are not attempting to reproduce in Medical Neuroscience online. Nevertheless, our aim is to faithfully present in scope and rigor a medical school caliber course experience.\n\nThis course comprises six units of content organized into 12 weeks, with an additional week for a comprehensive final exam:\n- Unit 1 Neuroanatomy (weeks 1-2). This unit covers the surface anatomy of the human brain, its internal structure, and the overall organization of sensory and motor systems in the brainstem and spinal cord.\n- Unit 2 Neural signaling (weeks 3-4). This unit addresses the fundamental mechanisms of neuronal excitability, signal generation and propagation, synaptic transmission, post synaptic mechanisms of signal integration, and neural plasticity.\n- Unit 3 Sensory systems (weeks 5-7). Here, you will learn the overall organization and function of the sensory systems that contribute to our sense of self relative to the world around us: somatic sensory systems, proprioception, vision, audition, and balance senses.\n- Unit 4 Motor systems (weeks 8-9). In this unit, we will examine the organization and function of the brain and spinal mechanisms that govern bodily movement.\n- Unit 5 Brain Development (week 10). Next, we turn our attention to the neurobiological mechanisms for building the nervous system in embryonic development and in early postnatal life; we will also consider how the brain changes across the lifespan.\n- Unit 6 Cognition (weeks 11-12). The course concludes with a survey of the association systems of the cerebral hemispheres, with an emphasis on cortical networks that integrate perception, memory and emotion in organizing behavior and planning for the future; we will also consider brain systems for maintaining homeostasis and regulating brain state.","instructors":[{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/instructor\/~901314","learners":"207,726","courses":"1","rate":"4.96\/5","rate_count":"207","name":"Leonard E.

Organizations learn by encoding inferences from history into organizational structures (so best practices into rules, routines, and roles), people, technologies (curricula), and culture (norms, beliefs) that guide behavior. That is, organizations reflect on what works well or not, and then encode that knowledge into its organizational elements (participants, technology\/tasks, social structure) so it can remember."]],[["Module 6 - Organizational Culture","3 hours to complete","In this module, we will cover organizational culture.

Think of the culture at firms like Apple or Facebook \u2013 all have an identity and norms surrounding their performance of it. As such, the motive in an organizational culture is the expression and fulfillment of an identity \u2013 a strong intrinsic motivator!

That is, a firm\u2019s success depends on whether it adopts structures that are deemed rational and legitimate in the external environment; that the firm mirrors environmental beliefs about what a legitimate organization of that type should look like.

"]]],"about":"In this introductory, self-paced course, you will learn multiple theories of organizational behavior and apply them to actual cases of organizational change.Organizations are groups whose members coordinate their behaviors in order to accomplish a shared goal. They can be found nearly everywhere in today\u2019s society: universities, start-ups, classrooms, hospitals, non-profits, government bureaus, corporations, restaurants, grocery stores, and professional associations are some of many examples of organizations.\n\nOrganizations are as varied and complex as they are ubiquitous: they differ in size and internal structure; they can entail a multiplicity of goals and tasks (some of which are planned and others unplanned!); they are made up of individuals whose goals and motivations may differ from those of the group; and they must interact with other organizations and deal with environmental constraints in order to be successful. This complexity frequently results in a myriad of problems for organizational participants and the organization\u2019s survival.\n\nIn this course, we will use organizational theories to systematically analyze how an organization operates and can best be managed. Organizational theories highlight certain features of an organization\u2019s structure and environment, as well as its processes of negotiation, production, and change. Each provides a lens for interpreting novel organizational situations and developing a sense for how individual and group behaviors are organized. Theories are valuable for the analyst and manager because most organizational problems are unique to the circumstances and cannot be solved by simple rules of thumb. Armed with a toolset of organizational theories, you will be able to systematically identify important features of an organization and the events transforming it; choose a theoretical framework most applicable to the observed mode of organizing; and use that theory to determine which actions will best redirect the organization in desired directions.\n\nIn sum, the course has three goals: to become familiar with a series of real-world organizational phenomena; to learn different theoretical perspectives that can elucidate these phenomena; and to apply these different ways of \u201cseeing\u201d and managing organizations to cases. In such a fashion, the course is designed to actively bridge theory and practice, exposing students to a variety of conceptual tools and ways to negotiate novel situations.","instructors":[{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/instructor\/~1139667","learners":"74,248","courses":"1","rate":"4.7\/5","rate_count":"100","name":"Daniel A.

The things to do this week are to watch the 4 videos, to answer the in-video questions, to read the notes, and to complete two problem sets (skeletal muscle and smooth & cardiac muscle). It will be most effective if you follow the sequence of videos. The notes provide a more detailed summary of each topic. We encourage you to find which resource (videos and\/or notes) works best for you and to try the problems sets. The problem sets are not graded. Both your understanding and retention will increase with application of the new learned information."]],[["Cardiovascular System","4 hours to complete","Welcome back! In this module we consider how the circulatory system works to deliver oxygen and nutrients to the specific organs. We start with a discussion of the electrical and mechanical functions of the heart which enable it to generate a pressure gradient. This pressure gradient propels the blood through the blood vessels, in a unidirectional manner.  The following session considers the factors that govern delivery of gases and nutrients at the tissue level. The last session considers the entire reflex loop, its control, and its response to daily demands (rest and exercise) and how pathology affects these responses. This is a busy week! The things to do this week are to watch the 5 videos, to answer the in-video questions, to read the notes, and to complete the CV problem set. It will be most effective if you follow the sequence of videos. The notes provide a more detailed summary of each topic. We encourage you to find which resource (videos and\/or notes) works best for you and to try the problems sets.  The problem sets are not graded. Both your understanding and retention will increase with application of the new learned information."]],[["Respiratory System","4 hours to complete","We hope that you are enjoying the course! This module considers the respiratory system. In these lessons, we explore topics such as how we get air into our lungs, the role of airway resistance in ventilation,  the transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the lungs and tissues, and the regulation of breathing. There are a couple of demonstrations of lung function in the videos!The things to do this week are to watch the 8 videos, to answer the in-video questions, to read the notes, and to complete the Respiratory System problem set. We suggest that you read the notes, watch the videos, and answer the in-video questions before you start on the problem sets, which are not graded. Take a deep breath and have fun with it!"]],[["The Endocrine System","4 hours to complete","IIn this module, we return our attention to the endocrine system and its role in the maintenance of homeostasis. In particular we consider the hypothalamus-pituitary axis, which integrates signals from the nervous system and from the blood to regulate most homeostatic functions, including growth, ion balance, fluid balance, response to stress, and energy use.  The first lesson gives an overview of the hypothalamus-pituitary axis and its actions in regulating growth of the body. In later lessons we consider how this complex negative feedback loop governs the body\u2019s energy use and its response to stress. Then, later in lesson 3, we turn our attention to the simple reflex loop by which the endocrine pancreas regulates metabolism in both the fed and fasted states and the failures of this system (diabetes mellitus).  The hypothalamus-pituitary axis and its control of reproduction in both males and females are considered in the next module (Module 9). The things to do this week are to watch the 6 videos, to answer the in-video questions, to read the notes, and to do the two problem sets (endocrine system and fuel homeostasis). Please note that each module can stand alone, however, it will be most effective if you do the first two videos (H-P-axis) before any of the others. The notes provide a more detailed summary of each topic and again we encourage you to use the resource (videos and\/or notes) that works best for you. Please do try the problems sets for self-review. Both your understanding and retention will increase with application of the new learned information."]],[["The Reproductive System","2 hours to complete","Welcome back! This module continues our discussion of the endocrine system and its control of homeostasis. In this series of videos, we consider how the endocrine system regulates the production of gametes (egg and sperm) in the female and male, respectively, as well as the production of the sex hormones. The things to do this week are to watch the 4 videos, to answer the in-video questions, to read the notes, and to complete the problem set. It will be most effective if you follow the sequence of the lectures on the reproductive system. Again please consult the notes for a more detailed summary of each topic. If you have not tried the problems sets, please do so. They will reinforce your understanding of the newly learned information by applying it. Since these problem sets are delivered in the same electronic format as the exams, by completing them, you will gain confidence in using the electronic test format."]],[["The Gastrointestinal System","3 hours to complete","Congratulations! You have almost completed this course. In this module, we consider the inner workings of your gut.  Most of our discussions deal with the function of specific regions of the gastrointestinal tract where complex foods are processed into solutes and nutrients that can be absorbed into the body for use as fuel. This \u201cprocessing plant\u201d acts in a unidirectional manner from mouth to anus and requires the coordinated secretions of acid, enzymes, bases, and fluids for its normal function.  What is unusual about the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and its accessory organs, salivary glands, liver, and pancreas, is that their coordinated actions occur in a timely manner without conscious input from the brain. Instead the gut integrates its diverse actions by locally produced chemicals (hormones and paracrines) as well as by the coordinated actions of the enteric nervous system, a subdivision of the autonomic nervous system.  In the last lesson of this module, we consider normal motility of the gut, as well as perturbations that result in gastrointestinal distress such as vomiting and diarrhea. The things to do this week are to watch the 4 videos, to answer the in-video questions, to read the notes, and to complete the gastrointestinal problem set. For this topic, the most effective approach will be to follow the sequence of videos as we move along the gastrointestinal tract. The notes provide a more detailed summary of the video lectures.  Again, please use the resource (videos and\/or notes) that works best for you. However, we encourage you to complete the problem sets as both your understanding and retention will increase with application of the new learned information.  Hope you enjoy the week!"]],[["The Urinary System","4 hours to complete","Welcome to module 11 and the last organ system to be covered in this course! In this module, we turn our attention to the urinary system and specifically to the functions of the kidney, a filter of the blood.  The kidney is a complicated organ whose actions integrate with those of the cardiovascular system to maintain blood pressure and with the respiratory system to maintain acid-base balance.  As we progress through this module, we consider the mechanisms by which the kidney regulates the water content and the electrolyte content of the body.  We focus on the roles of the normal kidney but also consider changes in homeostasis due to either disease or drugs.  The last lesson of this module considers the role of the kidney in regulating acid-base balance of the body and its integration with the respiratory system. The things to do this week are to watch the 6 videos, to answer the in-video questions, to read the notes, and to complete one problem set (urinary system).  In this module, the sequence of videos is important.  As you proceed through the videos and notes, try to correlate the specific region of the renal tubule with its function.  Often this is best achieved by drawing the renal tubule and labeling the specific changes in structure and function.  Again, the notes will provide a more detailed summary of the material presented in the videos.  Please note that the first two videos correlate with the first set of notes and the third video with the second set of notes. We encourage you to complete the problem set.  The problem set is not graded and is for your personal feedback. Both your understanding and retention will increase with application of the new learned information."]]],"about":"In this course, students learn to recognize and to apply the basic concepts that govern integrated body function (as an intact organism) in the body's nine organ systems.","instructors":[{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/instructor\/~868977","learners":"334,698","courses":"2","rate":"4.74\/5","rate_count":"345","name":"Jennifer Carbrey"},{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/instructor\/~920567","learners":"334,698","courses":"2","rate":"4.74\/5","rate_count":"345","name":"Emma Jakoi"}],"language":"English"},"communication-strategies-virtual-age":{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/communication-strategies-virtual-age","skill_gain":["Communication Theory","conflict resolution","Meeting","Public Speaking"],"syl_small":[[["Introduction to Virtual Teams and Virtual Communication","1 hour to complete","This module is intended to create a foundation for the course by challenging your ideas of not just what virtual communication means, but also communication as  a whole.

This week's topic is public key encryption: how to encrypt using a public key and decrypt using a secret key. Public key encryption is used for key management in encrypted file systems, in encrypted messaging systems, and for many other tasks.

We construct systems that are secure against tampering, also known as chosen ciphertext security (CCA security). There has been a ton of research on CCA security over the past decade and given the allotted time we can only summarize the main results from the last few years. The lectures contain suggestions for further readings for those interested in learning more about CCA secure public-key systems.

Would you like to learn about the latest valuation methods that may help you to make better business decisions? Then 'Advanced Valuation and Strategy \u2013 M&A, Private Equity, and Venture Capital' by Erasmus University Rotterdam is the right course for you! This course is helpful for executives that need to value complete strategies and for all students interested in corporate finance and strategy. We present the latest tools and show you how to apply them!\n\nWe will revolutionize your way of decision making, by extending static techniques from corporate finance with dynamic methods to quantify strategic thinking. Traditionally, we assess the attractiveness of an investment as a mature business, where future cash flows mainly result from past decisions. But, in an ever-changing world, strategic decisions determine the firm\u2019s long-term success and market value. Yet managers often have to consider these long-term implications using intuition and experience alone, with little guidance from structured, quantitative analysis.\n\nOur treatment goes far beyond the use of standard valuation analysis. We introduce the expanded NPV, which brings together DCF, real options, and game theory. Thinking in terms of options, games, and adaptive strategies may help managers address strategic questions such as: How do you value a leveraged buyout? How can you value a high-tech venture with negative cash flows? When should you invest in new ventures in stages? How can you incorporate rival bidders in the analysis?\n\nThe tools we provide can improve your decisions in business and in daily life.\n\n* Who is this class for?\nWe hope that our course appeals to (graduate) students in finance, economics, and business, as well as to high-ranking professionals and a general audience.

The fascinating thing about fashion is that everybody uses clothes every day. No matter where you live or how much money you have. It is something we all share. Therefore clothing is also an incredibly interesting starting point for a discussion about sustainability. It is something we can all relate to in one way or another. And as clothing is something we all wear, imagine the impact it could have if the fashion industry was to become more sustainable. In the last several years consumers have become increasingly aware of the unsustainable social and environmental practices of the fashion industry. To respond to this increase in critical consumers and survive as a business - also in the long term - fashion companies need to find more sustainable ways of doing business.

Such experiments can give us a good appreciation of the bare bone \"look and feel\" of the new computer, and lead to decisions that may well change and improve both the hardware and the language designs. Taking a similar approach, in this module we assume that the Hack computer and machine language have been built, and write some low-level programs using the Hack machine language.

In order to enjoy this luxury, someone has to translate our symbolic programs into binary code that can execute as-is on the target computer. This translation service is done by an agent called assembler. The assembler can be either a person who carries out the translation manually, or a computer program that automates the process. In this module and final project in the course we learn how to build an assembler. In particular, we'll develop the capability of translating symbolic Hack programs into binary code that can be executed as-is on the Hack platform.

You may work regularly with customers or suppliers abroad, or be part of a globally dispersed cross-functional team, or an expatriate manager on an international assignment. You may be a member of a global online community, or a development aid worker collaborating with an international network of partner organizations. In all of these contexts, your effectiveness as a leader depends on how well you understand and are able to manage individual and collective behaviors in an intercultural context. In this course \u2013 together with a team of Bocconi expert faculty and Bocconi alumni \u2013 we\u2019ll explore the theory and practice of international and intercultural leadership and organizational behavior. Social science research has revealed systematic ways in which our behavior differs across cultural contexts \u2013 enabling us to more effectively work across borders. Insights from psychology, neuroscience, sociology and anthropology, from communication studies and from management scholarship allow us to understand what shapes individual and group decision making, what enhances or weakens team performance, and how we can build and use our social networks. And the shared practical experience of international leaders allows us to identify concrete steps to enhancing intercultural leadership competence, and to be cognizant of common leadership challenges.\n\nLearning about organizational behavior provides a great opportunity to develop your leadership skills and to reflect on your own behavioral tendencies. How do you usually make important decisions? What motivates you and how do you try motivating others? How successfully do you leverage and integrate diverse skills and views in a team? Do you prefer professional relationships with a close-knit group of trusted colleagues, or with a far-flung network of acquaintances from all walks of life?\n\nIf you really want to learn how organizations behave and take decisions and at the same time develop leadership skills, then this is the course for you.\n\nWe are looking forward to welcoming you and supporting you on this journey of learning and discovery. \n\nCOURSE SYLLABUS\nWeek 1 - Leadership Acumen. International perspective on leadership, common traps & challenges, and opportunities of intercultural leadership. \nWeek 2 - Navigating Culture. Impact of cultural differences on organizations, decoding culture, culture classifications and stereotyping, developing intercultural intelligence. \nWeek 3 - Communication. Communication and its impact on leadership identity and relationships, managing communication to improve decision making, steps for developing your intercultural communication skills.\nWeek 4 - Motivation. Views on individual motivation, cultural differences in motivation, developing motivation and commitment in teams.\nWeek 5 - Networking. Patterns of interpersonal relationships in\/across organizations, strategically developing social networks and social capital, norms for networking across cultures.\nWeek 6 - Conflict. Effective \/ defective conflict management approaches, dealing with ethical dilemmas.\n\nThanks to the participation of our alumni and of the Bocconi Alumni Association, participants will have practical insights on international leadership.\n\nRECOMMENDED BACKGROUND\nAll are welcome!

I follow that with a more systematic introduction to this essential tool."]],[["Banking as a Clearing System","3 hours to complete","In the next four lectures, we build intuition by viewing banking as a payments system, in which every participant faces a daily settlement constraint (a survival constraint).  From this point of view, the wholesale money market plays a key role by allowing banks to relax the discipline of a binding settlement constraint, delaying final payment by putting settlement off until a later date.   The relative importance of the various money markets has changed since the 2008 crisis--Fed Funds is now less important--but the conceptual framework remains valid, indeed not only for dollar money markets but also for non-dollar money markets."]],[["Banking as a Clearing System, continued","3 hours to complete","The next two lectures extend the payments system frame to non-banks by bringing in repo markets, and to the international monetary system by bringing in Eurodollar markets.   Here, as in the previous two lectures, the emphasis is on settlement, and so implicitly on so-called \"funding liquidity\".  The last three segments of the Eurodollar lecture, on the failure of two seemingly obvious arbitrage conditions, are meant to motivate the shift to market-making and \"market liquidity\" in the next module.   "]],[["Banking as Market Making","3 hours to complete","\"Market liquidity\" is supplied by dealers who stand ready to absorb temporary imbalances in supply and demand by taking the imbalance onto their own balance sheets, for a price.  From this point of view, banks can be considered a special kind of dealer, since they absorb imbalances in payment flows.   The first lecture is meant to build intuition by using our familiar balance sheet method to make sense of how this all worked in a system much simpler than our own.  The second lecture introduces a formal model of the economics of the dealer function, which we will be using throughout the rest of the course. "]],[["Banking as Market Making, continued","3 hours to complete","Here we adapt the Treynor model to banks, which we conceptualize as dealers in money, specifically term funding.  Like Treynor's security dealers, banks supply market liquidity for a price.  But sometimes, in a financial crisis, demand for market liquidity overwhelms supply, and that's where the central bank comes in, as dealer of last resort in money markets.  And if the crisis is big enough, as 2007-2009, the central bank comes in as dealer of last resort in capital markets as well."]],[["Midterm review and exam","2 hours to complete","The first twelve lectures have introduced all of the main concepts of the course.

The first lecture is introductory and conceptual, while the second builds intuition by \"translating\" Mundell's account of the development of the international monetary system into money view language (similar to what we did at the beginning of the course for Allyn Young's account of the development of the US monetary system)."]],[["International Money and Banking, continued","3 hours to complete","The next two lectures use the Treynor model to understand how exchange rates are determined in dealer markets.

The first lecture is a kind of conceptual introduction, while the second translates the standard finance account of forwards and futures into money view terms, as key building block for what comes after."]],[["Banking as Advance Clearing, continued","3 hours to complete","In the modern economy, the price of risk is determined in swap markets that distinguish specific forms of risk, most importantly interest rate swaps and credit default swaps.  The Treynor model can be adapted to understand how the price of risk is formed in dealer markets."]],[["  Money in the Real World","3 hours to complete","In this final module, we bring the entire course together.  These two lectures build on everything that came before, and show how all the pieces fit together into a unified whole.  Specifically, the first lecture uses the conceptual apparatus of the money view to make sense of shadow banking as the quintessential form of banking for the modern financially globalized world.  And the second lecture shows how the conceptual apparatus of the money view fits with standard economics view and finance view, by drawing attention to dimensions of the world from which the standard views abstract."]],[["Final Exam","1 hour to complete","The previous module operated in effect as a review of the entire course, so if you were able to make sense of those lectures, you are ready for the final.  But maybe you first want to have a look back at the second lecture, \"The Natural Hierarchy of Money\", for a high-level summary of the essential concepts of the money view.  For almost everybody, the money view is a new and unfamiliar way of thinking about the world, and it takes a while to get used to it.  The purpose of this course is to plant the seed, by demonstrating the value of this way of thinking for making sense of real world problems.  Once you are done with the final exam, the real work begins, of using the money view to make sense of whatever real world problems confront you in your own daily life."]]],"about":"The last three or four decades have seen a remarkable evolution in the institutions that comprise the modern monetary system. The financial crisis of 2007-2009 is a wakeup call that we need a similar evolution in the analytical apparatus and theories that we use to understand that system. Produced and sponsored by the Institute for New Economic Thinking, this course is an attempt to begin the process of new economic thinking by reviving and updating some forgotten traditions in monetary thought that have become newly relevant.Three features of the new system are central.\n\nMost important, the intertwining of previously separate capital markets and money markets has produced a system with new dynamics as well as new vulnerabilities. The financial crisis revealed those vulnerabilities for all to see. The result was two years of desperate innovation by central banking authorities as they tried first this, and then that, in an effort to stem the collapse.  \n\nSecond, the global character of the crisis has revealed the global character of the system, which is something new in postwar history but not at all new from a longer time perspective.  Central bank cooperation was key to stemming the collapse, and the details of that cooperation hint at the outlines of an emerging new international monetary order. \n\nThird, absolutely central to the crisis was the operation of key derivative contracts, most importantly credit default swaps and foreign exchange swaps. Modern money cannot be understood separately from modern finance, nor can modern monetary theory be constructed separately from modern financial theory. That's the reason this course places dealers, in both capital markets and money markets, at the very center of the picture, as profit-seeking suppliers of market liquidity to the new system of market-based credit.","instructors":[{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/instructor\/~3149120","learners":"96,142","courses":"1","rate":"4.89\/5","rate_count":"113","name":"Perry G Mehrling"}],"language":"English"},"modern-art-ideas":{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/modern-art-ideas","skill_gain":["Creativity","Art","History","Art History","Art Direction"],"syl_small":[[["Module 1: Introduction to Modern Art & Ideas","1 hour to complete","Be introduced to some of the overall benefits of studying modern and contemporary art through accessible and relevant themes."]],[["Module 2: Places & Spaces","3 hours to complete","Discover some of the many ways that artists represent place and take inspiration from their environment."]],[["Module 3: Art & Identity","2 hours to complete","See how artists create works of art to express, explore, and question identity.

Without these mental shortcuts, we would be paralyzed by the multitude of daily choices. But in certain circumstances, these shortcuts lead to predictable errors \u2013 predictable, that is, if we know what to watch out for. Did you know, for example, that we are naturally biased towards selling investments that are doing well for us, but holding on to those that are doing poorly? Or that we often select sub-optimal insurance payment plans, and routinely purchase insurance that we don\u2019t even need? And why do so many of us fail to enroll in our employer\u2019s corporate retirement plans, even when the employer offers to match our contributions?Behavioral finance is the study of these and dozens of other financial decision-making errors that can be avoided, if we are familiar with the biases that cause them.

In this course you will learn the different stages of clinical development as well as the regulatory including but not limited to, an Investigational New Drug Application (IND), New Drug Application (NDA), and product labeling.  Additionally you will learn how to Incorporate study design methods for consideration in the design of clinical protocols to assess safety, tolerability, and efficacy in multiple therapeutic areas.\n\nIn this course you will learn the different phases of clinical development:\n\n* Phase 1 or early stage clinical trial are conducted primar\u00adily to determine how the new drug works in humans, its safety profile and to predict its dosage range.  It typically involves between 30 and 100 healthy volunteers.\n\n* Phase 2 or Proof of Concept POC studies test for efficacy as well as safety and side effects in a group of between 30  to 200 hundred  patients with  the disease for which the new drug is being developed.\n\n* Phase 3 or late stage clinical development involve much larger group of patients, between a few hundred to thousands, depending on the indication, which will  help  determine if the new drug can be considered both safe and effective.  It will involve control groups using placebo and\/or current treatment as a comparison.\n\n* Product registration and approval process after a drug is considered safe and effective from Phase 3 trials, it must be authorized in each individual country before  it can  be  marketed. All data gen\u00aderated about the small molecule or biologic is collected  and  submitted to the regulatory authorities in the US at the FDA, Food and Drug Administration FDA, in Europe the EMA or European Medicines Agency, Japan Ministry of Health and other countries which may require their own national  approvals.\n\nThis course is intended as part 2 of a series: Drug Discovery (https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/drug-discovery), Drug Development and Drug Commercialization (https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/drug-commercialization).  We would highly recommend that you take the courses in order since it will give you a better understanding on how a drug is discovered in the lab before being tested in clinical trials and then launched in the market place.","instructors":[{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/instructor\/ettouati","learners":"101,064","courses":"3","rate":"4.55\/5","rate_count":"258","name":"Williams S.

You really need to understand this technology, and this course is a great place to get that understanding. Or you might just be following the news reports about AI and interested in finding out more about the hottest new technology of the moment. Whoever you are, we are looking forward to guiding you through you first machine learning project.NB this course is designed to introduce you to Machine Learning without needing any programming. That means that we don't cover the programming based machine learning tools like python and TensorFlow.","instructors":[{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/instructor\/marcogillies","learners":"336,731","courses":"12","rate":"4.78\/5","rate_count":"548","name":"Dr Marco Gillies"}],"language":"English"},"clinical-research":{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/clinical-research","skill_gain":["Clinical Research","Statistics","Statistical Analysis","Statistical Hypothesis Testing"],"syl_small":[[["Getting things started by defining study types","5 hours to complete","Welcome to the first week. Here we\u2019ll provide an intuitive understanding of clinical research results. So this isn\u2019t a comprehensive statistics course - rather it offers a practical orientation to the field of medical research and commonly used statistical analysis. The first topics we will look at are research methods and data collection with a specific focus on study types. By the end, you should be able to identify which study types are being used and why the researchers selected them, when you are later reading a published paper."]],[["Describing your data ","6 hours to complete","We finally get started with the statistics. Have you ever looked at the methods and results section of any healthcare research publication and noted the variety of statistical tests used?  You would have come across terms like t-test, Mann-Whitney-U test, Wilcoxon test, Fisher\u2019s exact test, and the ubiquitous chi-squared test.  Why so many tests you might wonder?  It\u2019s all about types of data.  This week  I am going to tackle the differences in data that determine what type of statistical test we can use in making sense of our data."]],[["Building an intuitive understanding of statistical analysis","5 hours to complete","There is hardly any healthcare professional who is unfamiliar with the p-value.  It is usually understood to have a watershed value of 0.05.  If a research question is evaluated through the collection of data points and statistical analysis reveals a value less that 0.05, we accept this a proof that some significant difference was found, at least statistically.In reality things are a bit more complicated than that.  The literature is currently full of questions about the ubiquitous p-vale and why it is not the panacea many of us have used it as. During this week you will develop an intuitive understanding of concept of a p-value. From there, I'll move on to the heart of probability theory, the Central Limit Theorem and data distribution."]],[["The important first steps: Hypothesis testing and confidence levels","4 hours to complete","In general, a researcher has a question in mind that he or she needs to answer. Everyone might have an opinion on this question (or answer), but a researcher looks for the answer by designing an experiment and investigating the outcome. First, we will look at hypotheses and how they relate to ethical and unbiased research and reporting. We'll also tackle confidence intervals which I believe are one of the least understood and often misrepresented values in healthcare research. The most common tests used in the literature to compare numerical data point values are t-tests, analysis of variance, and linear regression.  In the last lesson we take a closer look at these tests, but perhaps more importantly, their strict assumptions. "]],[["Which test should you use?","4 hours to complete","The most common statistical test that you might come across in the literature is the t-test.  There are, in actual fact, a few t-tests, but the one most are familiar with, is of course, Student\u2019s t-test and its ubiquitous p-value.  Not everyone, though, knows that the name Student was actually a pseudonym, used by William Gosset (1876 - 1937).  Parametric tests have very strict assumptions that must be met before their use is justified.  In this lesson we take a closer look at these tests, but perhaps more importantly, their strict assumptions.  Once you know these, you will be able to identify when these tests are used inappropriately."]],[["Categorical data and analyzing accuracy of results ","3 hours to complete","Congratulations!

In this module, we will look at the story of an entrepreneur, Chris Cartter, and his start-up, MeYouHealth, as they worked with Boston design firm, Essential Design, to understand the kind of opportunity that social networking might hold for helping us to improve our health. Examining what already exists is the first step in the design thinking process. As part of assessing \"what is?\", designers \u201cfollow the customer home\u201d and explore the problems they are trying to solve in life versus their product use. Once they have thoroughly explored and looked for patterns, designers look toward the future and ask \"what if?\" This is the creative part of the process, but it also requires a disciplined approach. By the end of this module, you'll understand how to use design thinking to generate innovative ideas, how to apply the \"what is?\" and \"what if?\" questions, and how to use the Mind Mapping tool."]],[["Experimentation","1 hour to complete","Having generated all of these innovative ideas, what\u2019s next? The design thinking process now helps us to take the many ideas we have generated and figure out how to determine which ones are likely to produce the specific kinds of outcomes we want, whether these take the form of improved nutrition for the elderly (e.g., The Good Kitchen), healthier lifestyle choices (e.g., MeYouHealth) or even more \u201chot leads\u201d emanating from your trade shows (as in the IBM example to follow). In this module, we will follow the activities of an IBM team working closely with experience marketing agency George P. Johnson as they develop and test ideas for a revolutionary approach to trade show participation. This process begins by asking \"what wows?\". This question brings together the customer and business cases supporting our new concepts. Typically, the \u201cwow\u201d zone occurs at the intersection of three criteria: 1) somebody wants it, 2) we can create and deliver it, and 3) doing so has the potential to produce the outcomes we want. Then we ask \"what works?\" and conduct small experiments to test if our assumptions are accurate.

However, despite the rhetoric, in many ways and at most institutional sites, education is still relatively untouched by technology. Even when technologies are introduced, the changes sometimes seem insignificant and the results seem disappointing. If the print textbook is replaced by an e-book, do the social relations of knowledge and learning necessarily change at all or for the better? If the pen-and-paper test is mechanized, does this change the nature of our assessment systems? Technology, in other words, need not necessarily bring significant change.

We see political uprisings, market crashes, and a never ending array of social trends. How do we make sense of it? Models. Evidence shows that people who think with models consistently outperform those who don't. And, moreover people who think with lots of models outperform people who use only one. Why do models make us better thinkers? Models help us to better organize information - to make sense of that fire hose or hairball of data (choose your metaphor) available on the Internet. Models improve our abilities to make accurate forecasts. They help us make better decisions and adopt more effective strategies. They even can improve our ability to design institutions and procedures. In this class, I present a starter kit of models: I start with models of tipping points. I move on to cover models explain the wisdom of crowds, models that show why some countries are rich and some are poor, and models that help unpack the strategic decisions of firm and politicians. The models covered in this class provide a foundation for future social science classes, whether they be in economics, political science, business, or sociology. Mastering this material will give you a huge leg up in advanced courses. They also help you in life. Here's how the course will work. For each model, I present a short, easily digestible overview lecture. Then, I'll dig deeper. I'll go into the technical details of the model. Those technical lectures won't require calculus but be prepared for some algebra. For all the lectures, I'll offer some questions and we'll have quizzes and even a final exam. If you decide to do the deep dive, and take all the quizzes and the exam, you'll receive a Course Certificate.

Some of them have to do with events of great importance, such as the founding of a nation. Others tell the stories of great heroes and heroines and their exploits and courage in the face of adversity. Still others are simple tales about otherwise unremarkable people who get into trouble or do some great deed. What are we to make of all these tales, and why do people seem to like to hear them? This course will focus on the myths of ancient Greece and Rome, as a way of exploring the nature of myth and the function it plays for individuals, societies, and nations. We will also pay some attention to the way the Greeks and Romans themselves understood their own myths. Are myths subtle codes that contain some universal truth? Are they a window on the deep recesses of a particular culture? Are they a set of blinders that all of us wear, though we do not realize it? Or are they just entertaining stories that people like to tell over and over? This course will investigate these questions through a variety of topics, including the creation of the universe, the relationship between gods and mortals, human nature, religion, the family, sex, love, madness, and death.***********************************************************************************************************\n                                                                           \nCOURSE SCHEDULE\n \n\u2022 Week 1: Introduction \nWelcome to Greek and Roman Mythology!

Also, the idea that the rights of the child are a 20th Century invention will be balanced.

These rights are considered the most \u201crevolutionary\u201d under the provisions of the UNCRC because they challenge traditional and tokenistic conceptions of childhood. The challenge however also lies in the balance to be found, in all settings, between structural adaptations necessary to favour child participation and the evolving capacities of the children themselves, who can only progressively exert their own rights directly. Another aspect is participation of children as individuals or as groups, notably their collective decision-making capacity. It looks like practice has outstripped theory. The difference between the child as a subject of rights and the child\u2019s real agency as a social actor needs more theoretical frameworks, as the problem of implementation is also a problem of our own understanding of agency. Among the modes of recognition, rights are only a limited part of the reality experienced by children mainly in terms of affection and esteem. The challenges of implementing children\u2019s participation rights in a series of settings, as recommended by CRC General Comment Nr 12, are therefore conveying an analysis of the terms used (maturity, freely expressed views, etc.) that may include children\u2019s own perspectives on these issues. Examples of procedures for the implementation of children\u2019s participation rights highlight all these challenges and the difficulties of defining good indicators of child participation. Besides, child participation should also be guaranteed even when children are viewed as \u201cdeviant\u201d or \u201cdelinquent\u201d: the respect for child participation in judicial settings highlights the complex interplay between one\u2019s status and one\u2019s rights in practice. Eventually, as child participation should be guaranteed in all settings, research itself should be child-friendly and participative and ethical principles for researchers must be specified when dealing with children."]],[["Children\u2019s rights and global health","1 hour to complete","Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity (Preamble to the Constitution of the World Health Organization 22 July 1946). Certain traditional practices committed on children compromise sometimes severely both their physical and moral development and thus affect their health. These practices while explicitly prohibited by the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) at. art. 24.3 CRC are widely committed in quasi total impunity. Even if some traditional harmful practices concern more specific regions of the globe, due to migratory movements, in fine every State is concerned. Global health is a universal concept of human rights and contributes to, the realization of many other children\u2019s rights such as the right of non-discrimination (art. 2 CRC), the right to life, survival and development (art.6 CRC), the right to participation (art. 12 CRC) the right to privacy (art. 16 CRC) or the right to access to information (art. 17 CRC).

Through concrete data sets and easy to use software the course provides data science knowledge that can be applied directly to analyze and improve processes in a variety of domains.Data science is the profession of the future, because organizations that are unable to use (big) data in a smart way will not survive. It is not sufficient to focus on data storage and data analysis. The data scientist also needs to relate data to process analysis. Process mining bridges the gap between traditional model-based process analysis (e.g., simulation and other business process management techniques) and data-centric analysis techniques such as machine learning and data mining. Process mining seeks the confrontation between event data (i.e., observed behavior) and process models (hand-made or discovered automatically). This technology has become available only recently, but it can be applied to any type of operational processes (organizations and systems). Example applications include: analyzing treatment processes in hospitals, improving customer service processes in a multinational, understanding the browsing behavior of customers using booking site, analyzing failures of a baggage handling system, and improving the user interface of an X-ray machine. All of these applications have in common that dynamic behavior needs to be related to process models. Hence, we refer to this as \"data science in action\".\n\nThe course explains the key analysis techniques in process mining. Participants will learn various process discovery algorithms. These can be used to automatically learn process models from raw event data. Various other process analysis techniques that use event data will be presented. Moreover, the course will provide easy-to-use software, real-life data sets, and practical skills to directly apply the theory in a variety of application domains.\n\nThis course starts with an overview of approaches and technologies that use event data to support decision making and business process (re)design. Then the course focuses on process mining as a bridge between data mining and business process modeling. The course is at an introductory level with various practical assignments.\n\nThe course covers the three main types of process mining.\n\n1. The first type of process mining is discovery. A discovery technique takes an event log and produces a process model without using any a-priori information. An example is the Alpha-algorithm that takes an event log and produces a process model (a Petri net) explaining the behavior recorded in the log.\n\n2. The second type of process mining is conformance. Here, an existing process model is compared with an event log of the same process. Conformance checking can be used to check if reality, as recorded in the log, conforms to the model and vice versa.\n\n3. The third type of process mining is enhancement. Here, the idea is to extend or improve an existing process model using information about the actual process recorded in some event log. Whereas conformance checking measures the alignment between model and reality, this third type of process mining aims at changing or extending the a-priori model. An example is the extension of a process model with performance information, e.g., showing bottlenecks. Process mining techniques can be used in an offline, but also online setting. The latter is known as operational support. An example is the detection of non-conformance at the moment the deviation actually takes place. Another example is time prediction for running cases, i.e., given a partially executed case the remaining processing time is estimated based on historic information of similar cases.\n\nProcess mining provides not only a bridge between data mining and business process management; it also helps to address the classical divide between \"business\" and \"IT\". Evidence-based business process management based on process mining helps to create a common ground for business process improvement and information systems development.\n\nThe course uses many examples using real-life event logs to illustrate the concepts and algorithms. After taking this course, one is able to run process mining projects and have a good understanding of the Business Process Intelligence field.\n\nAfter taking this course you should:\n- have a good understanding of Business Process Intelligence techniques (in particular process mining),\n- understand the role of Big Data in today\u2019s society,\n- be able to relate process mining techniques to other analysis techniques such as simulation, business intelligence, data mining, machine learning, and verification,\n- be able to apply basic process discovery techniques to learn a process model from an event log (both manually and using tools),\n- be able to apply basic conformance checking techniques to compare event logs and process models (both manually and using tools),\n- be able to extend a process model with information extracted from the event log (e.g., show bottlenecks),\n- have a good understanding of the data needed to start a process mining project,\n- be able to characterize the questions that can be answered based on such event data,\n- explain how process mining can also be used for operational support (prediction and recommendation), and\n- be able to conduct process mining projects in a structured manner.","instructors":[{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/instructor\/wilvanderaalst","learners":"46,234","courses":"1","rate":"4.9\/5","rate_count":"60","name":"Wil van der AalstTop Instructor"}],"language":"English"},"project-planning-1":{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/project-planning-1","skill_gain":[],"syl_small":[[["Introduction, Quality Metrics, and Contracts","8 hours to complete","Successful projects do not just happen.

The new competitive landscape requires another, more holistic and strategic perspective, based on the concept of business models.This course gives you access to the Odyssey 3.14 approach, a pioneering framework that will help you invent or reinvent business models.\n\nThis highly innovative approach has been developed by Laurence Lehmann-Ortega and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Musikas and has proven to be a very valuable methodology for start-up entrepreneurs, business unit managers and intrapreneurs alike. It offers a practical and highly effective framework and toolbox to create, invent or reinvent business models in a very disciplined way.\n\nThe approach starts with a deep dive into the 3 pillars of the business model:\n- The value proposition (who are our customers and what are we offering them?)\n- The value architecture (how are we organized in order to deliver this value proposition to our customers in due time)\n- The profit equation (how the alignment between the first 2 pillars generates a profit)\n\n14 directions are then explored in order to invent or reinvent a business model. Examples of the directions include \u201creducing clients overall costs\u201d, \u201cmodifying the revenue stream\u201d, \u201cintroducing a third party\u201d, \u201celiminating a step in the value chain\u201d, and \u201cexploring new resources\u201d. Illustrated by numerous examples, both iconic (Ikea, Tetra Pack, Grameen Bank\u2026) and more recent (Airbnb, Zopa, Drive Now\u2026), these directions stimulate your creativity to rigorously explore all possible innovation paths. Innovation becomes an adventure, an odyssey\u2026 hence the name of the approach!\n\nOdyssey 3.14 is the result of over 15 years of research, consulting and teaching. Over 150 companies that have successfully invented or reinvented their business model have been thoroughly analyzed and will inspire you to develop your own new, innovative business model.\n\nThis course is a part of the MSIE program at HEC.

By the end of this module, you should feel comfortable valuing claims and making financing decisions in which the timing of the cash flows and compounding of interest is arbitrary (e.g., annual, semi-quarterly, monthly, etc.). Having worked through the problems, you should also be more comfortable with real world financial decision making related to retirement savings, home financing and refinancing, auto leases, and other scenarios. "]],[["Week 4: Return on Investment","1 hour to complete","This module closes out our discussion of discounted cash flow analysis and caps off the course with a discussion of return on investment. By the end of this module, you should feel comfortable with the notion of free cash flow and the ability to apply a set of forecast drivers to project free cash flows into the future.

Here we will provide an overview of where algorithms and data structures are used (hint: everywhere) and walk you through a few sample programming challenges. The programming challenges represent an important (and often the most difficult!) part of this specialization because the only way to fully understand an algorithm is to implement it. Writing correct and efficient programs is hard; please don\u2019t be surprised if they don\u2019t work as you planned\u2014our first programs did not work either! We will help you on your journey through the specialization by showing how to implement your first programming challenges. We will also introduce testing techniques that will help increase your chances of passing assignments on your first attempt. In case your program does not work as intended, we will show how to fix it, even if you don\u2019t yet know which test your implementation is failing on."]],[["Algorithmic Warm-up","5 hours to complete","In this module you will learn that programs based on efficient algorithms can solve the same problem billions of times faster than programs based on na\u00efve algorithms. You will learn how to estimate the running time and memory of an algorithm without even implementing it. Armed with this knowledge, you will be able to compare various algorithms, select the most efficient ones, and finally implement them as our programming challenges!"]],[["Greedy Algorithms","7 hours to complete","In this module you will learn about seemingly na\u00efve yet powerful class of algorithms called greedy algorithms. After you will learn the key idea behind the greedy algorithms, you may feel that they represent the algorithmic Swiss army knife that can be applied to solve nearly all programming challenges in this course. But be warned: with a few exceptions that we will cover, this intuitive idea rarely works in practice! For this reason, it is important to prove that a greedy algorithm always produces an optimal solution before using this algorithm. In the end of this module, we will test your intuition and taste for greedy algorithms by offering several programming challenges."]],[["Divide-and-Conquer","8 hours to complete","In this module you will learn about a powerful algorithmic technique called Divide and Conquer. Based on this technique, you will see how to search huge databases millions of times faster than using na\u00efve linear search. You will even learn that the standard way to multiply numbers (that you learned in the grade school) is far from the being the fastest! We will then apply the divide-and-conquer technique to design two efficient algorithms (merge sort and quick sort) for sorting huge lists, a problem that finds many applications in practice. Finally, we will show that these two algorithms are optimal, that is, no algorithm can sort faster!"]],[["Dynamic Programming 1","7 hours to complete","In this final module of the course you will learn about the powerful algorithmic technique for solving many optimization problems called Dynamic Programming. It turned out that dynamic programming can solve many problems that evade all attempts to solve them using greedy or divide-and-conquer strategy. There are countless applications of dynamic programming in practice: from maximizing the advertisement revenue of a TV station, to search for similar Internet pages, to gene finding (the problem where biologists need to find the minimum number of mutations to transform one gene into another). You will learn how the same idea helps to automatically make spelling corrections and to show the differences between two versions of the same text.

Why do we do it?  Because it\u2019s fun?   Because it energizes or relaxes us?   Because it keeps us current, allows us to understand what\u2019s happening in past and popular culture?    The pull of music--especially classical music\u2014has never been explained.   The aim of this course is to do just that:  To explicate the mysteries and beauties of some of Western cultures greatest musical compositions\u2014among them masterpieces of Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Wagner, and Puccini. We begin with the elements of music, breaking classical musical into its components of pitch, duration, and sound color, allowing us to better understand how music works.   Next, we proceed to the compositions themselves, starting with the Middle Ages and Renaissance, to show how Western music developed in ways unique to the West.  Ultimately, we reach the masters, commencing with Bach. What makes his music great?   Why does it move us? What should we listen for? And so we proceed down through Western musical history, visiting virtually the people who created it and the places where they did so. By the end, we hope all of us have become more human (enriched our personalities) and had a rollicking good time!"]],[["How Music Works, it's Magic.","8 hours to complete","What is Music? Is music simply the organization of sounds and silences passing through time? Or is it more? Poet Victor Hugo believes music is \"what feelings sound like.\" In this first module, we\u2019ll take apart Hugo\u2019s seemingly simple statement by spending some time asking how and why music induces strong emotions in people across different cultures. We\u2019ll begin with a look at the inner workings of the human ear to determine how our brains process sound waves.  Then, we\u2019ll travel to different parts of the world, comparing and contrasting both traditional and popular Western music with sounds from various regions and cultures. You\u2019ll find that it is both culture and the physics of music that determine why we like the music we like!  From there, we\u2019ll be ready to take a look at the basic elements of musical composition; rhythm, melody, texture, etc. We\u2019ll also learn how classical composers used these elements in some of their most famous works and how modern artists are still using them today. Finally, we will see how the elements of musical composition have evolved over time and how they have been translated to a universal language enjoyed and understood by millions."]],[["The Sound of Music","6 hours to complete","Have you ever wondered what it is that makes music sound sometimes rich and luxurious and sometimes strange and mysterious? Well, you\u2019re in luck because this module, we\u2019ll explore what the nature of simultaneous sounds and textures. We\u2019ll start off with a look at chords, specifically how the three types of triads\u2013 tonic, dominant, subdominant\u2013 build a foundation upon which a melody can be constructed. Once we understand the rules of musical syntax, we\u2019ll be ready to learn about musical progressions including the three types of cadences.We\u2019ll also look at major and minor triads and how they work. Then, we\u2019ll learn how to hear the bass and focus on the harmony of a song. Finally, I\u2019ll talk you through the four families of musical instruments\u2013brasses, percussions, strings, and woodwinds---and the various musical textures, forms, and styles that they can create.  How exciting!"]],[["Music Back in the Day","5 hours to complete","We will cover a thousand years in musical evolution during this modules lectures! We'll start with the Middle Ages taking a look at its functional chants and dance music, then we\u2019ll move to the period of the Renaissance, and finish off by listening to the ornate melodies of opera heard throughout the early Baroque period. From this, you\u2019ll begin to see how advances in musical notation allowed compositions to become both more specific and more complex. These advances are ultimately responsible for focus being shifted away from the performers and towards the composers themselves.Along the way, we\u2019ll highlight some of these musical inventors and innovators, such as Hildegard of Bingen and Johann Pachelbel. We\u2019ll also have the unique opportunity to see (and in some cases even hear) many of the instruments that were popular during these different time periods. This will be a real treat, made possible with help from Yale instructor, Grant Herreid. Many thanks are owed to him!"]],[["The Baroque Era","9 hours to complete","Novelists, poets, painters, mathematicians, and even geologists talk about \"fugue-like\" structure in their media and disciplines.   But what is a fugue and how did we get it? To find out, we enter the world of Baroque music and famed master of the fugue, Johann Sebastian Bach.     First, we'll get a chance to \"live\" during the Baroque period by taking a detailed look inside the life, career, and even home of Bach-- explore where and how Bach and his family lived, discuss Bach\u2019s music, and talk about the techniques of Baroque music as a whole.      Next, Bach\u2019s music will then be compared and contrasted with that of his exact contemporary and fellow German, George Frideric Handel. One might say that Bach was an idealist and Handel was a realist when it came to music, so we\u2019ll look at how these personality traits informed each composer\u2019s musical style.        Finally, we'll wrap up the module with an introduction to music of the Classical Period, and who better to lead the way than the inimitable Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart?"]],[["The Classical Era","8 hours to complete","Would you believe that once upon a time, musical compositions were viewed as disposable, one-time-use entertainment?  Could you imagine an orchestra attempting to perform a beautiful piece over the sounds of noisy patrons in a casino? How about a violin being drowned out by a dog loudly barking outside of a caf\u00e9? Well, this was the reality before the turn of the 18th century. It wasn\u2019t until around 1800 that people began to appreciate musical compositions, as they do today. This was the same time we started to see large concert halls created specifically for the purpose of listening to concerts. Not long after, music was seen as something to be elevated and studied, in other words it became, \u201cHigh Art.\u201d This week, we\u2019ll start by listening to music by Haydn and Mozart, getting our grounding, so to speak, in musical form. As we proceed, we'll also see where and how they lived, compare how they wrote and performed their music, and even look at some of the exact instruments they performed on all those years ago.We\u2019ll spend latter part of the module highlighting two figures that stand at the very heart of Western music.The first is Mozart, a well-dressed, confident, eccentric, and ever brilliant innovator. We\u2019ll explore his music through the lens of three artistic masterpieces: a piano concerto, an opera, and the Requiem mass... We\u2019ll delve into the unique features of the music that make it the gold standard for all music for centuries to come.  Perhaps the high (or low) point arrives  when your instructor is ruthlessness murdered on stage by the feckless Don Giovanni.We\u2019ll then shift over to Beethoven\u2013 a passionate, conflicted, and oft-times disheveled genius. His physical appearance may very well have served as the prototype for the stereotypical, \u201cstruggling bard,\u201d or \u201ctortured genius.\u201d We\u2019ll study some of his most famous sonatas, including his Moonlight Sonata and then go beyond his music to explore his personal life, including his struggle with deafness and depression."]],[["The Bridge From Classical to Romantic","9 hours to complete","If you could put a soundtrack to the French Revolution, it would surely contain music from Beethoven's \"Heroic\" period, during which, he \u201cbrought sound to symphonies.\u201d We\u2019ll see how Beethoven\u2019s incorporation of new instruments, as well as, his creation of a large orchestra, made his symphonies much louder and \"sonically vivid\" than those of his predecessors.  The point of focus here will be a comparison of the music of Beethoven's \"Heroic\" period, represented by his Symphony No. 5,  with that of his \"Late\" period, epitomized by his famous Ode to Joy. We'll also consider Beethoven the man, as revealed through primary source accounts of his life at that time. They paint a picture of a disheveled, wild-looking Beethoven, who lived among filth and clutter and was consumed by his work.  The ultimate question: in what ways might his life of isolation and his hearing disability affected the nature (style) of the great music he created?As we bid aufwiedersehen to Beethoven, we move on to full-blown musical Romanticism. Romantic music, and indeed all romantic art, was known for its idealistic views on love and nature. Occurring roughly from 1820 to 1900, musical Romanticism saw an evolution of musical style as well as a change of venue (place) for musical performance.  In addition to the aristocracy and their royal palaces, a strong middle class arose in Europe during this period.  With the music of the ever-lyrical Franz Schubert, we'll step into the parlor of an upper-middle class home, to experience his domestic chamber music and songs. We\u2019ll finish off the module by asking the question: How do we use musical sound to communicate? A look at program music (instrumental music that uses musical gestures to tell a story) will help us figure this out. After a quick auditory review of the workings of program music (we'll follow Vivaldi on a spring day), we'll watch Hector Berlioz go to hell. More accurately, we\u2019ll follow the sequence of musical gestures he employs to re-create a fantastical tale of pursuit, destruction, damnation.  Having learned our lesson,  we\u2019ll end with a little fun as we try to match themes extracted from various symphonies to the mental images that the composer had in mind.  Do you speak the language of program music fluently? Join us and find out! "]],[["The Romantic Era","10 hours to complete","Module 8 will begin with a tour of Yale\u2019s extraordinary keyboard collection; perhaps the finest of its kind in the world. We\u2019ll see fully functioning instruments of all shapes and sizes, some dating back to the time of Mozart and before!  We\u2019ll learn the preferred brands and styles of some of the finest pianists of all time, Haydn, Beethoven, Liszt, Chopin, and Schubert to name a few. We\u2019ll even get to hear some of these instruments played by musical educator and concert pianist Robert Blocker.  His performances will help us hear exactly how advances in technology changed the sound and capabilities of pianos during this time period. Our next session this module covers a rather polarizing topic:  Opera. Many people find the Opera too artificial, too long, and sometimes just plain boring; others enjoy nothing more than this glamorous art form. We\u2019ll spend some time making a case for the power and beauty, indeed the magic, of Opera. Maybe, we\u2019ll be able persuade some naysayers along the way.  Because it is impossible to encompass all of Romantic opera in an hour, we'll concentrate on the masterpieces of Verdi and the groundbreaking music dramas of Wagner.   Perhaps the only figure who can reasonably by compared to Beethoven in terms of musical originality and innovation, Wagner changed the face of 19th century music.  We\u2019ll explore Wagner by briefly analyzing his Ring Cycle.  This innovative cycle of librettos, based on Norse mythology, contains some of the most iconic and recognizable music from the period. Wagner's use of \"leitmotifs\u201d made detailed storytelling possible,  with the music even conveying the subconscious thought of singers on stage, a truly revolutionary feat. His work would go on to serve as inspiration for writers and film makers such as Tolkien, Lewis, Lucas, and Martin, not to mention countless composers. In the final lesson of this module, we\u2019ll expand our focus to look at the orchestra as a whole during the Romantic period.  Just 60 years after Mozart led his thirty-five-player orchestra, it was not uncommon to see Wagner and Mahler conducting ensembles with well over 100 members. In addition to increased numbers, the instruments themselves changed. Technological advances, transformed previously one dimensional instruments, such as the French horn, into versatile tools, capable of projecting a completely chromatic melody.  This newfound versatility allowed composers like Brahms and Mahler to experiment with and forever redefine orchestral instrumentation.  "]],[["Music to the Present","8 hours to complete","When you think of Impressionism, you probably think of paintings, likely the beautiful canvases of Claude Monet. But the emotionally evocative, non-realistic style of Impressionism pervaded all aspects of art. For music, another Claude, this time Debussy, typified the Impressionist movement.  After learning about the sometimes outrageous lives of some of history\u2019s famous composers, it may shock you to hear that Debussy led a rather banal existence, with no depression, psychosis or family tragedy to speak of.  But from an ordinary life can come extraordinary music! We\u2019ll look at three pieces, one each from his early, middle, and late career, to see how Debussy's style shifted away from more goal-oriented Romanticism to the \u201clive in the moment\u201d style that came to define Impressionism. After a brief guitar lesson taught with the help of the talented Solomon Silber, we\u2019ll continue on to the Modernist period. As is well known to all by now, musical style is constantly changing. Sometimes the change is subtle, like the shift from Classical to Romantic music. At other times, however, change crashes like a Tsunami against previous traditions.  This is what we experience as we engage the bracing sounds of Modernism. Beginning in the early 20th century, composers such as Igor Stravinsky and Arnold Schoenberg abandoned traditional melody and scale. Simply put, audiences were, at times, less than receptive to this change. We\u2019ll listen to samples of the music that provoked audience hostility, and discuss what seems to make this music so inaccessible, at times downright unpleasant, for most listeners.We will close this week, and our course, with Postmodernism and Minimalism. We\u2019ll see how composers like Aaron Copland brought orchestral music back to the people by paring it down to its most basic terms. We\u2019ll then hear how artists such as  Philip Glass and John Adams, took this idea and ran with it, composing captivating trance-like movements around the simplest of ideas.

You can think of calculus as simply a set of tools for analysing the relationship between functions and their inputs. Often, in machine learning, we are trying to find the inputs which enable a function to best match the data. We start this module from the basics, by recalling what a function is and where we might encounter one. Following this, we talk about the how, when sketching a function on a graph, the slope describes the rate of change of the output with respect to an input. Using this visual intuition we next derive a robust mathematical definition of a derivative, which we then use to differentiate some interesting functions. Finally, by studying a few examples, we develop four handy time saving rules that enable us to speed up differentiation for many common scenarios."]],[["Multivariate calculus","3 hours to complete","Building on the foundations of the previous module, we now generalise our calculus tools to handle multivariable systems. This means we can take a function with multiple inputs and determine the influence of each of them separately. It would not be unusual for a machine learning method to require the analysis of a function with thousands of inputs, so we will also introduce the linear algebra structures necessary for storing the results of our multivariate calculus analysis in an orderly fashion.  "]],[["Multivariate chain rule and its applications","3 hours to complete","Having seen that multivariate calculus is really no more complicated than the univariate case, we now focus on applications of the chain rule. Neural networks are one of the most popular and successful conceptual structures in machine learning. They are build up from a connected web of neurons and inspired by the structure of biological brains. The behaviour of each neuron is influenced by a set of control parameters, each of which needs to be optimised to best fit the data. The multivariate chain rule can be used to calculate the influence of each parameter of the networks, allow them to be updated during training. "]],[["Taylor series and linearisation","3 hours to complete","The Taylor series is a method for re-expressing functions as polynomial series. This approach is the rational behind the use of simple linear approximations to complicated functions. In this module, we will derive the formal expression for the univariate Taylor series and discuss some important consequences of this result relevant to machine learning. Finally, we will discuss the multivariate case and see how the Jacobian and the Hessian come in to play. "]],[["Intro to optimisation","2 hours to complete","If we want to find the minimum and maximum points of a function then we can use multivariate calculus to do this, say to optimise the parameters  (the space) of a function to fit some data.  First we\u2019ll do this in one dimension and use the gradient to give us estimates of where the zero points of that function are, and then iterate in the Newton-Raphson method.  Then we\u2019ll extend the idea to multiple dimensions by finding the gradient vector, Grad, which is the vector of the Jacobian.  This will then let us find our way to the minima and maxima in what is called the gradient descent method.  We\u2019ll then take a moment to use Grad to find the minima and maxima along a constraint in the space, which is the Lagrange multipliers method."]],[["Regression","2 hours to complete","In order to optimise the fitting parameters of a fitting function to the best fit for some data, we need a way to define how good our fit is.

Then we\u2019ll look at how to optimise our fitting function using chi-squared in the general case using the gradient descent method. Finally, we\u2019ll look at how to do this easily in Python in just a few lines of code, which will wrap up the course."]]],"about":"This course offers a brief introduction to the multivariate calculus required to build many common machine learning techniques. We start at the very beginning with a refresher on the \u201crise over run\u201d formulation of a slope, before converting this to the formal definition of the gradient of a function. We then start to build up a set of tools for making calculus easier and faster. Next, we learn how to calculate vectors that point up hill on multidimensional surfaces and even put this into action using an interactive game. We take a look at how we can use calculus to build approximations to functions, as well as helping us to quantify how accurate we should expect those approximations to be. We also spend some time talking about where calculus comes up in the training of neural networks, before finally showing you how it is applied in linear regression models. This course is intended to offer an intuitive understanding of calculus, as well as the language necessary to look concepts up yourselves when you get stuck. Hopefully, without going into too much detail, you\u2019ll still come away with the confidence to dive into some more focused machine learning courses in future.","instructors":[{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/instructor\/samuel-cooper","learners":"220,874","courses":"2","rate":"4.7\/5","rate_count":"277","name":"Samuel J.

Our goal will be to go behind the myth-making and beyond the popularized presentations of relativity in order to gain a deeper understanding of both Einstein the person and the concepts, predictions, and strange paradoxes of his theory. Some of the questions we will address include: How did Einstein come up with his ideas? What was the nature of his genius? What is the meaning of relativity? What\u2019s \u201cspecial\u201d about the special theory of relativity? Why did the theory initially seem to be dead on arrival? What does it mean to say that time is the \u201cfourth dimension\u201d? Can time actually run more slowly for one person than another, and the size of things change depending on their velocity? Is time travel possible, and if so, how? Why can\u2019t things travel faster than the speed of light? Is it possible to travel to the center of the galaxy and return in one lifetime? Is there any evidence that definitively confirms the theory, or is it mainly speculation? Why didn\u2019t Einstein win the Nobel Prize for the theory of relativity?About the instructor: Dr. Larry Lagerstrom is the Director of Academic Programs at Stanford University\u2019s Center for Professional Development, which offers graduate certificates in subjects such as artificial intelligence, cyber security, data mining, nanotechnology, innovation, and management science.

Over the past decades, a new figure has emerged that of the art manager. Imagine you went to work every day to connect artists with audiences, vision with reality, and money with a mission. That is what managers in the arts do, they play an essential role in transforming the minds, lives, and communities through creative expression.\n\t\nThis course has been conceptualized to address the need of skills and techniques to help professionals and managers in running art and cultural institutions. \n\nLearning Objectives\nThere are three objectives to this course. First, we will approach the biggest issue cultural institutions face, the coexistence of managers and curators and giving evidence as to when, how, and why they can get along. Second, we will focus on some contemporary facets on what is means to manage a cultural institution and what cultural managers should expect and be able to face. And lastly, we will provide models and tools to design and implement appropriate courses of action to satisfy customers (visitors and audiences) and build an advantage over the competition.\n\nCourse Structure\nThe course is divided into six sections. Five sections are dedicated to specific aspects and themes of managing cultural institutions, while the sixth section is dedicated to individual interviews of prominent cultural institution managers on specific topics. The involvement of professionals and managers gives an incredible value to the learning experience of this course. \n\nEach module is paired with a\u00a0quiz\u00a0and discussion forums to reflect on the variety of the heritage management, its complexity, and the power of the network that we will build together during the course.\nSuccessful completion of the quizzes is required for a course certificate as explained in the Grading Policy page.\n\nIf you love art and want to make an impact in this unique and fantastic sector, this course will support you in understanding the peculiarities of this sector and how to leverage on its tools to make a bigger impact.\n\nLook forward to meeting you online!\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nVatican Museums:\u00a0www.museivaticani.va\nCenacolo Vinciano:\u00a0\nwww.beniculturali.it\/mibac\/export\/MiBAC\/sito-MiBAC\/Contenuti\/MibacUnif\/Eventi\/visualizza_asset.html_1283837989.html (ITA)\nFAI (Fondo Ambiente Italiano):\u00a0eng.fondoambiente.it\nMUVE (Fondazione Musei Civici Venezia):\u00a0www.visitmuve.it\nThe National Trust:\u00a0www.nationaltrust.org.uk\nThe Archeological Site of Paestum:\u00a0www.museopaestum.beniculturali.it   whc.unesco.org\/en\/list\/842\nMuseo dell'Opera del Duomo (Florence):\u00a0www.museumflorence.com\nMuseo del Violino:\u00a0www.museodelviolino.org\n_________________________________\nDisclaimer - Since some of the videos are conducted with those whose native language is not English, we have decided to sometimes preserve their more emphatic speech to keep a tighter match between the audio and subtitles.","instructors":[{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/instructor\/andrearurale","learners":"19,855","courses":"1","rate":"4.68\/5","rate_count":"140","name":"Andrea Rurale"}],"language":"English"},"international-security-management":{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/international-security-management","skill_gain":[],"syl_small":[[["An introduction to the international security landscape","1 hour to complete","Welcome to the first week of our MOOC!

According to the OECD, the global infrastructure investment requirement by 2030 for transport, electricity generation, transmission & distribution, and water & telecommunications totals to 71 trillion dollars. This figure represents about 3.5% of the annual World GDP from 2007 to 2030.\n\nThe European Commission estimated, that by 2020, Europe will need between 1.5 - 2 trillion Euros in infrastructure investments. Between 2011 and 2020, about 500 billion Euros will be required for the implementation of the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) program, 400 billion Euros for Energy distribution networks and smart grids, 200 billion Euros on Energy transmission networks and storage, and 500 billion Euros for the upgrade and construction of new power plants. An additional 38 - 58 billion Euros and 181 - 268 billion Euros in capital investment will be needed to achieve the targets set by the European Commission for broadband diffusion.\n\nTraditionally investments in infrastructure were financed using public sources. However, severe budget constraints and inefficient management of infrastructure by public entities have led to an increased involvement of private investors in the business. \n\nThe course focuses on how private investors approach infrastructure projects from the standpoint of equity, debt, and hybrid instruments. \n\nThe course concentrates on the practical aspects of project finance: the most frequently used financial techniques for infrastructure investments. The repeated use of real life examples and case studies will allow students to link the theoretical background to actual business practices.\n\nIn the end of the course, students will be capable of analyzing a complex transaction, identifying the key elements of a deal, and suggesting proper solutions for deal structuring from a financial advisor's perspective.\n\nCourse Format\nThe course will consist of lecture videos, readings, and talks given by guest speakers. Although we do hope you will attend the entire course, it is possible to just focus on single topics.\n\nSuggested Readings\nThe course is designed to be self-contained, there are no obligatory readings that must be acquired outside of the course. \nFor students interested in additional study material, you may refer to:\n\u2022\tGatti Stefano, \"Project Finance in theory and practice\", Academic Press, 2nd edition, 2012.","instructors":[{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/instructor\/stefanogatti","learners":"28,595","courses":"3","rate":"4.84\/5","rate_count":"155","name":"Stefano Gatti"}],"language":"English"},"public-policy":{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/public-policy","skill_gain":[],"syl_small":[[["Course Roadmap","1 hour to complete","Professor Warburg and his UVa graduate teaching assistants outline the approach of the course and highlight upcoming topics and speakers."]],[["Public Policy Challenges in the 21st Century","1 hour to complete","Professor Warburg outlines global public policy challenges the next generation will face, as classroom participants collaborate in defining the future agenda."]],[["The Media and Changing Nature of Politics","2 hours to complete","Clinton White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers explains issue framing, coalition building and how modern media in shapes public policy options."]],[["Healthcare Systems and Insurance Markets","1 hour to complete","Professor Eric Patashnik examines healthcare reforms, weighing costs, benefits and the efficacy of alternative approaches, including 'Obamacare.'"]],[["Federalism and the Power of State Governors","1 hour to complete","Professor Ray Scheppach examines the powerful role state governors play, examining how states serve as \u2018laboratories\u2019 for federal policy options in Washington."]],[["US-China Relations","1 hour to complete","Professor Harry Harding details the complex, all-important relationship between the U.S. and China, outlining different scenarios for future competition and cooperation."]],[["Congress and Politics","1 hour to complete","Congressman Gerry Connolly and former House Republican leader Tom Davis offer insights into how Congress meets public policy challenges."]],[["War Powers","2 hours to complete","U.S. Senator Tim Kaine discusses how American citizens, in an age of drone strikes and asymmetrical warfare, decide to commit the nation to war."]],[["Wrapping Up - Positive Change and Closing","1 hour to complete","Professor Warburg reviews key course themes, analytical skills and the importance of civic engagement with the public policy agenda ahead."]]],"about":"This course introduces class participants to the political significance and societal consequences of challenges facing U.S. and international policymakers.

The very idea that individuals can be taught to lead is not without its skeptics. Reasonable people, even some scholars in the field, point to the important traits, skills, and attributes that are observed in many visible leaders and contend that certain qualities necessary for effective leadership are not easily transmitted. To accept this premise and conclude that some people are born as natural leaders and others cannot be expected to lead at all is to make a mistake at the other end of the logical spectrum. We believe that leadership can be taught as long as it is concurrently nurtured, that most people possess a constellation of strengths around which they can construct their own leadership philosophy and approach, and that leadership development programming\u2014if done well\u2014can be transformative for organizers and participants.Course Level Objectives:\nUnderstand the historical narrative of institutions as well as institutional structures that have created instances of inclusion and exclusion in colleges and universities. \nDescribe how transformational leadership is enacted for diversity, equity, and inclusion in a complex and contested environment.\nCompare legislative, governance, and public accountability and expectations in relation to contemporary issues in higher education.\nAnalyze the strategic diversity planning process and documents of a selected institution. \nRecommend innovations and opportunities for transformational change at various levels of the ecological model using the strategic diversity planning process as a tool.","instructors":[{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/instructor\/johnburkhardt","learners":"9,010","courses":"1","rate":"4.82\/5","rate_count":"19","name":"Dr. John C.

Much of the course will focus on five questions: What do people get sick, disabled and die from; Why do they suffer from these conditions? Which people are most affected? Why should we care about such concerns? What can be done to address key health issues, hopefully at least cost, as fast as possible, and in sustainable ways?  The course will be global in coverage but with a focus on low- and middle-income countries, the health of the poor, and health disparities. Particular attention will be paid throughout the course to health systems issues, the linkages between health and development, and health matters related to global interdependence. The course will cover key concepts and frameworks but be practical in orientation.ESSENTIALS OF GLOBAL HEALTH WAS PRODUCED IN PART DUE TO THE GENEROUS FUNDING OF THE DAVID F.

You\u2019ll also investigate if the effect of an independent variable depends on the level of another independent variable by including interaction terms in the multiple regression model. Another aspect of this module is learning how to evaluate models, regression or otherwise, to find the most favorable levels of the independent variables. For models that explain revenue, the most favorable levels of the independent variables will maximize revenue. In contrast, if you have a model that describes costs, like a budget, then the most favorable levels of the independent variables will minimize costs. Optimizing models can be difficult because there are so many inputs and constraints that need to be managed.

From the earliest days of the profession, Luca Pacioli emphasized the importance of math and order for analyzing business transactions. The skillset that accountants have needed to perform math and to keep order has evolved from pencil and paper, to typewriters and calculators, then to spreadsheets and accounting software. A new skillset that is becoming more important for nearly every aspect of business is that of big data analytics: analyzing large amounts of data to find actionable insights. This course is designed to help accounting students develop an analytical mindset and prepare them to use data analytic programming languages like Python and R.We\u2019ve divided the course into three main sections. In the first section, we bridge accountancy to analytics. We identify how tasks in the five major subdomains of accounting (i.e., financial, managerial, audit, tax, and systems) have historically required an analytical mindset, and we then explore how those tasks can be  completed more effectively and efficiently by using big data analytics. We then present a FACT framework for guiding big data analytics: Frame a question, Assemble data, Calculate the data, and Tell others about the results.\n \nIn the second section of the course, we emphasize the importance of assembling data. Using financial statement data, we explain desirable characteristics of both data and datasets that will lead to effective calculations and visualizations.\n \nIn the third, and largest section of the course, we demonstrate and explore how Excel and Tableau can be used to analyze big data. We describe visual perception principles and then apply those principles to create effective visualizations. We then examine fundamental data analytic tools, such as regression, linear programming (using Excel Solver), and clustering in the context of point of sale data and loan data. We conclude by demonstrating the power of data analytic programming languages to assemble, visualize, and analyze data. We introduce Visual Basic for Applications  as an example of a programming language, and the Visual Basic Editor as an example of an integrated development environment (IDE).","instructors":[{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/instructor\/ronald-guymon","learners":"20,883","courses":"3","rate":"4.91\/5","rate_count":"72","name":"Ronald GuymonTop Instructor"}],"language":"English"},"spanish-vocabulary-meeting-people":{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/spanish-vocabulary-meeting-people","skill_gain":[],"syl_small":[[["Module 1: Talking About Family and Friends","4 hours to complete","The first module introduces Spanish grammar and pronunciation and you will begin to build your Spanish vocabulary.

The Greeks and Romans describe aspects of Egypt's culture and history.As the 19th century began, the Napoleonic campaign in Egypt highlighted the wonders of this ancient land, and public interest soared.  Not long after, Champollion deciphered Egypt's hieroglyphs and paved the way for other scholars to reveal that Egyptian texts dealt with medicine, dentistry, veterinary practices, mathematics, literature, and accounting, and many other topics. Then, early in the 20th century, Howard Carter discovered the tomb of Tutankhamun and its fabulous contents. Exhibitions of this treasure a few decades later resulted in the world's first blockbuster, and its revival in the 21st century has kept interest alive.\n\nJoin Dr. David Silverman, Professor of Egyptology at Penn, Curator in Charge of the Egyptian Section of the Penn Museum, and curator of the Tutankhamun exhibitions  on a guided tour of the mysteries and wonders of this ancient land.

It\u2019s an essential area of skill and knowledge for graphic designers. Typography predates modern graphic design by around 500 years; it is rich in rules, conventions, and esoteric terminology\u2014but it remains an exciting space for invention and expression.In this rigorous introductory course, we will study, name, and measure the characteristics of letterforms. We\u2019ll consider the pragmatic concerns involved in selecting and combining type. We\u2019ll peek into the \u2028rich historical, cultural, and aesthetic histories of familiar typefaces. We\u2019ll discuss time-tested conventions and best practices in setting type, as governed by principles of hierarchy and spatial organization. And we\u2019ll explore the expressive, meaning-making potential of type. \n\nInformative lectures will be complemented by a series of three peer-assessed assignments, culminating \u2028in an opportunity to design a full-scale typographic poster.\n\nPlease note that this is not a software course; a basic working knowledge of Adobe InDesign or other \u2028page layout software will be assumed.

All around us - even in a developed city like Sydney - there are significant sites, but we often don't notice them. From ancient rock engravings to contemporary public art projects, significant sites serve as a reminder of the ongoing presence and occupation of the Sydney area by Aboriginal people for thousands of years. In this Module, we will be shown some sites by the CEO and Cultural Officer of the Metropolitan Local Aboriginal Land Council. We will also be introduced to the work of the City of Sydney council who are working on raising awareness and understanding about Aboriginal people in Sydney. "]],[["Resistance","2 hours to complete","This week we will focus on stories and experiences of resistance and activism, many of which were fostered in Sydney's inner city areas. For many years, Aboriginal people from around the country came to Sydney and settled near the industrial areas, finding work there and making their home in Sydney's inner city suburbs. In particular, the suburb of Redfern is the birthplace of contemporary Aboriginal political consciousness, where the fight for self-determination became tangible. The people we hear from this week share their stories on how they have negotiated their identities and made sense of their own experiences within this context. "]]],"about":"This course explores some of the key themes and capabilities of cultural competence by exploring Aboriginal experiences and narratives of Sydney. Australia was \u2018claimed\u2019 for the British Crown in 1770, by Captain James Cook, but the invasion began in earnest when the First Fleet of British arrived in 1788 and established a penal colony in Sydney.   \n\nAs a consequence Sydney is a city rich in diverse pre-colonial, colonial and contemporary sites of significance to Aboriginal peoples. Too often though our perceptions about Aboriginal peoples consign them to an ancient past or perpetuates stereotypical imaginations that Aboriginal peoples live in remote communities (Hinkson, 2010).  \n\nAt the heart of this MOOC is the theme that Sovereignty was never ceded and Sydney always was and always will be Aboriginal Land. Despite this the Aboriginal presence in the city is often invisible to non-Aboriginal eyes. This course aims to bring to light marginalised narratives of Aboriginal presence in this space.\n\nTo understand hidden and marginalised narratives and experiences it is necessary to develop cultural competence capabilities. Key elements of practicing cultural competence include being able to understand and interrogate context, which in the case of Sydney includes not only learning about the peoples, places and histories of Aboriginal Sydney but to also understand issues about how knowledge is created and how dominant narratives can exclude diverse knowledges and experiences. \n\nCourse learning outcomes\n\n1.\tDevelop knowledge about cultural competence capabilities. \n2.\tDevelop a deeper and multi-layered knowledge and understanding about Aboriginal peoples, cultures and places in Sydney.\n3.\tDevelop a greater understanding of how history, cultures and places are represented, contested and interpreted and how that relates to their own context. \n\nAcknowledgement of Country\n\nWe acknowledge that this course was developed on the land of the Gadigal Peoples of the Eora nation. We pay our respect to the Traditional Owners of this land and acknowledge that the land that the University of Sydney was built on has been a place of learning for many thousands of years.","instructors":[{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/instructor\/gabrielle-russell-mundine","learners":"7,729","courses":"1","rate":"4.82\/5","rate_count":"26","name":"Gabrielle Russell"}],"language":"English"},"excel-intermediate-2":{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/excel-intermediate-2","skill_gain":["Lookup Table","Microsoft Excel Vba","Data Validation","Microsoft Excel Macro"],"syl_small":[[["Data Validation","5 hours to complete","We kick off this course with data validation and conditional formatting.

You could also use Git to manage the many continuously improving revisions of that book that you are writing. In this course, you will not learn everything there is to know about Git, but you will build a strong conceptual understanding of the technology, and afterward will be able to confidently dig deeper on any topic that interests you. This course assumes no previous knowledge of Git, but if you do have experience with it, you may find this course to be both useful and challenging. This is especially true if you currently \"know just enough Git to be dangerous\". \n\nThere are two paths in this course. Both rely heavily on hands-on labs. One path assumes that you have experience using a command line interface, and the other path uses the Sourcetree graphical client. If you are not experienced with a command line, we highly suggest that you go through the Sourcetree path. Eventually, you might want to go through both paths, so that you can decide which tool to use for specific tasks. Besides, repetition is good for learning :)\n\nYou can watch the videos and take the quizzes from your phone if you want, but the hands-on labs require you to have a Windows or Mac computer. If you use the command line path through the course, you can also use Linux. \n\nThis course uses Bitbucket (bitbucket.org) as the hosted provider for remote Git repositories. Bitbucket is free for teams of up to 5 people, including private repositories. However, most of the knowledge that you gain in this course applies to Git itself, and you can apply this knowledge to other hosted Git providers (such as GitHub). \n\nThis course tries to be as concise as possible. It will probably take you about 5-10 hours to go through one of the two paths, but your mileage may vary.","instructors":[{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/instructor\/stevebyrnes","learners":"113,065","courses":"2","rate":"4.72\/5","rate_count":"252","name":"Steve Byrnes"}],"language":"English"},"erasmus-econometrics":{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/erasmus-econometrics","skill_gain":["Linear Regression","Time Series","Econometrics","Regression Analysis"],"syl_small":[[["Welcome Module","29 minutes to complete","Welcome!

It will also have a lecture case study from startup to success.\n\nIn addition, the course will discuss post-marketing clinical trials or Phase 4 trials. These are conducted after a new drug has been approved by the regulatory agencies and launched. In these studies, the new drug is prescribed in an everyday healthcare environ\u00adment using a much larger group  of patients.  This enables new treat\u00adment uses for the new drug to be developed, comparisons with other treatments for the same indication to be made, and determination  of the clinical  effectiveness of the new drug in  a wider variety of  patient types, and  more rare side effects, if any, may be detected .\n\nPre-marketing strategy should be instigated as early as Phase 1 clinical trials to ensure that the market's needs are incorporated into the new drug's overall develop\u00adment. Later phases when clinical results are presented at international medical conferences the marketing strategy is then refined in  order to develop an awareness amongst the medical community who will be prescribing the new drug. In addition to the marketing strategy, pricing strategy and a tactical plan will be developed. Promotional material, and the sales force will be trained so that when the product is approved they can promote the drug to physician, pharmacist and nurses.  \n\nThis course is intended as part 3 of a series: Drug Discovery (https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/drug-discovery), Drug Development (https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/drug-development) and Drug Commercialization.  We would highly recommend that you take the courses in order since it will give you a better understanding on how a drug is discovered in the lab before being tested in clinical trials and then launched in the market place.","instructors":[{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/instructor\/ettouati","learners":"101,064","courses":"3","rate":"4.57\/5","rate_count":"109","name":"Williams S.

You will emerge with substantial vocabulary and practical knowledge of how to apply business data analysis methods based on binary classification (module 2), information theory and entropy measures (module 3), and linear regression (module 4 and 5), all using no software tools more  complex than Excel. "],["Excel Essentials for Beginners","2 hours to complete","In this module, will explore the essential Excel skills to address typical business situations you may encounter in the future. The Excel vocabulary and functions taught throughout this module make it possible for you to understand the additional explanatory Excel spreadsheets that accompany later videos in this course. "]],[["Binary Classification","2 hours to complete","Separating collections into two categories, such as \u201cbuy this stock, don\u2019t but that stock\u201d or \u201ctarget this customer with a special offer, but not that one\u201d is the ultimate goal of most business data-analysis projects. There is a specialized vocabulary of measures for comparing and optimizing the performance of the algorithms used to classify collections into two groups. You will learn how and why to apply these different metrics, including how to calculate the all-important AUC: the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve. "]],[["Information Measures","2 hours to complete","In this module, you will learn how to calculate and apply the vitally useful uncertainty metric known as \u201centropy.\u201d In contrast to the more familiar \u201cprobability\u201d that represents the uncertainty that a single outcome will occur, \u201centropy\u201d quantifies the aggregate uncertainty of all possible outcomes.The entropy measure provides the framework for accountability in data-analytic work. Entropy gives you the power to quantify the uncertainty of future outcomes relevant to your business twice: using the best-available estimates before you begin a project, and then again after you have built a predictive model.\nThe difference between the two measures is the Information Gain contributed by your work."]],[["Linear Regression","3 hours to complete","The Linear Correlation measure is a much richer metric for evaluating associations than is commonly realized. You can use it to quantify how much a linear model reduces uncertainty.  When used to forecast future outcomes, it can be converted into a \u201cpoint estimate\u201d plus a \u201cconfidence interval,\u201d or converted into an information gain measure. You will develop a fluent knowledge of these concepts and the many valuable uses to which linear regression is put in business data analysis. This module also teaches how to use the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to solve practical problems. The two topics are closely related because regression and the CLT both make use of a special family of probability distributions called \u201cGaussians.\u201d You will learn everything you need to know to work with Gaussians in these and other contexts. "]],[["Additional Skills for Model Building","1 hour to complete","This module gives you additional valuable concepts and skills related to building high-quality models. As you know, a \u201cmodel\u201d is a description of a process applied to available data (inputs) that produces an estimate of a future and as yet unknown outcome as output. \nVery often, models for outputs take the form of a probability distribution. This module covers how to estimate probability distributions from data (a \u201cprobability histogram\u201d), and how to describe and generate the most useful probability distributions used by data scientists. It also covers in detail how to develop a binary classification model with parameters optimized to maximize the AUC, and how to apply linear regression models when your input consists of multiple types of data for each event. \nThe module concludes with an explanation of \u201cover-fitting\u201d which is the main reason that apparently good predictive models often fail in real life business settings. We conclude with some tips for how you can avoid over-fitting in you own predictive model for the final project \u2013 and in real life."]],[["Final Course Project","10 hours to complete","The final course project is a comprehensive assessment covering all of the course material, and consists of four quizzes and a peer review assignment.  For quiz one and quiz two, there are learning points that explain components of the quiz.  These learning points will unlock only after you complete the quiz with a passing grade. Before you start, please read through the final project instructions.  From past student experience, the final project which includes all the quizzes and peer assessment, takes anywhere from 10-12 hours."]]],"about":"Important: The focus of this course is on math - specifically, data-analysis concepts and methods - not on Excel for its own sake. We use Excel to do our calculations, and all math formulas are given as Excel Spreadsheets, but we do not attempt to cover Excel Macros, Visual Basic, Pivot Tables, or other intermediate-to-advanced Excel functionality.This course will prepare you to design and implement realistic predictive models based on data. In the Final Project (module 6) you will assume the role of a business data analyst for a bank, and develop two different predictive models to determine which applicants for credit cards should be accepted and which rejected. Your first model will focus on minimizing default risk, and your second on maximizing bank profits. The two models should demonstrate to you in a practical, hands-on way the idea that your choice of business metric drives your choice of an optimal model.\n\nThe second big idea this course seeks to demonstrate is that your data-analysis results cannot and should not aim to eliminate all uncertainty. Your role as a data-analyst is to reduce uncertainty for decision-makers by a financially valuable increment, while quantifying how much uncertainty remains. You will learn to calculate and apply to real-world examples the most important uncertainty measures used in business, including classification error rates, entropy of information, and confidence intervals for linear regression.\n\nAll the data you need is provided within the course, all assignments are designed to be done in MS Excel, and you will learn enough Excel to complete all assignments. The course will give you enough practice with Excel to become fluent in its most commonly used business functions, and you\u2019ll be ready to learn any other Excel functionality you might need in the future (module 1).\n\nThe course does not cover Visual Basic or Pivot Tables and you will not need them to complete the assignments. All advanced concepts are demonstrated in individual Excel spreadsheet templates that you can use to answer relevant questions.

We\u2019ll talk about cases and variables, and we\u2019ll explain how you can order them in a so-called data matrix. We\u2019ll discuss various levels of measurement and we\u2019ll show you how you can present your data by means of tables and graphs. We\u2019ll also introduce measures of central tendency (like mode, median and mean) and dispersion (like range, interquartile range, variance and standard deviation). We\u2019ll not only tell you how to interpret them; we\u2019ll also explain how you can compute them. Finally, we\u2019ll tell you more about z-scores. In this module we\u2019ll only discuss situations in which we analyze one single variable. This is what we call univariate analysis. In the next module we will also introduce studies in which more variables are involved."]],[["Correlation and Regression","3 hours to complete","In this second module we\u2019ll look at bivariate analyses: studies with two variables. First we\u2019ll introduce the concept of correlation. We\u2019ll investigate contingency tables (when it comes to categorical variables) and scatterplots (regarding quantitative variables). We\u2019ll also learn how to understand and compute one of the most frequently used measures of correlation: Pearson's r. In the next part of the module we\u2019ll introduce the method of OLS regression analysis. We\u2019ll explain how you (or the computer) can find the regression line and how you can describe this line by means of an equation. We\u2019ll show you that you can assess how well the regression line fits your data by means of the so-called r-squared. We conclude the module with a discussion of why you should always be very careful when interpreting the results of a regression analysis.     "]],[["Probability","3 hours to complete","This module introduces concepts from probability theory and the rules for calculating with probabilities. This is not only useful for answering various kinds of applied statistical questions but also to understand the statistical analyses that will be introduced in subsequent modules. We start by describing randomness, and explain how random events surround us. Next, we provide an intuitive definition of probability through an example and relate this to the concepts of events, sample space and random trials. A graphical tool to understand these concepts is introduced here as well, the tree-diagram.Thereafter a number of concepts from set theory are explained and related to probability calculations. Here the relation is made to tree-diagrams again, as well as contingency tables. We end with a lesson where conditional probabilities, independence and Bayes rule are explained. All in all, this is quite a theoretical module on a topic that is not always easy to grasp. That's why we have included as many intuitive examples as possible."]],[["Probability Distributions","3 hours to complete","Probability distributions form the core of many statistical calculations. They are used as mathematical models to represent some random phenomenon and subsequently answer statistical questions about that phenomenon. This module starts by explaining the basic properties of a probability distribution, highlighting how it quantifies a random variable and also pointing out how it differs between discrete and continuous random variables. Subsequently the cumulative probability distribution is introduced and its properties and usage are explained as well. In a next lecture it is shown how a random variable with its associated probability distribution can be characterized by statistics like a mean and variance, just like observational data. The effects of changing random variables by multiplication or addition on these statistics are explained as well.The lecture thereafter introduces the normal distribution, starting by explaining its functional form and some general properties. Next, the basic usage of the normal distribution to calculate probabilities is explained. And in a final lecture the binomial distribution, an important probability distribution for discrete data, is introduced and further explained. By the end of this module you have covered quite some ground and have a solid basis to answer the most frequently encountered statistical questions. Importantly, the fundamental knowledge about probability distributions that is presented here will also provide a solid basis to learn about inferential statistics in the next modules."]],[["Sampling Distributions","3 hours to complete","Methods for summarizing sample data are called descriptive statistics. However, in most studies we\u2019re not interested in samples, but in underlying populations. If we employ data obtained from a sample to draw conclusions about a wider population, we are using methods of inferential statistics. It is therefore of essential importance that you know how you should draw samples. In this module we\u2019ll pay attention to good sampling methods as well as some poor practices. To draw conclusions about the population a sample is from, researchers make use of a probability distribution that is very important in the world of statistics: the sampling distribution. We\u2019ll discuss sampling distributions in great detail and compare them to data distributions and population distributions. We\u2019ll look at the sampling distribution of the sample mean and the sampling distribution of the sample proportion. "]],[["Confidence Intervals","3 hours to complete","We can distinguish two types of statistical inference methods. We can: (1) estimate population parameters; and (2) test hypotheses about these parameters. In this module we\u2019ll talk about the first type of inferential statistics: estimation by means of a confidence interval. A confidence interval is a range of numbers, which, most likely, contains the actual population value. The  probability that the interval actually contains the population value is what we call the confidence level. In this module we\u2019ll show you how you can construct confidence intervals for means and proportions and how you should interpret them. We\u2019ll also pay attention to how you can decide how large your sample size should be."]],[["Significance Tests","3 hours to complete","In this module we\u2019ll talk about statistical hypotheses. They form the main ingredients of the method of significance testing. An hypothesis is nothing more than an expectation about a population. When we conduct a significance test, we use (just like when we construct a confidence interval) sample data to draw inferences about population parameters. The significance test is, therefore, also a method of inferential statistics. We\u2019ll show that each significance test is based on two hypotheses:  the null hypothesis and  the alternative hypothesis. When you do a significance test, you assume that the null hypothesis is true unless your data provide strong evidence against it. We\u2019ll show you how you can conduct a significance test about a mean and how you can conduct a test about a proportion. We\u2019ll also demonstrate that significance tests and confidence intervals are closely related. We conclude the module by arguing that you can make right and wrong decisions while doing a test. Wrong decisions are referred to as Type I and Type II errors."]],[["Exam time!","1 hour to complete","This is the final module, where you can apply everything you've learned until now in the final exam.

Llega un momento en el que los poderes p\u00fablicos \"deciden\" y las pol\u00edticas p\u00fablicas -o sus reformas- ven la luz: se retrasa la edad de jubilaci\u00f3n, se decide urbanizar una antigua zona industrial, se incluye un nuevo tratamiento en la cartera de servicios de la sanidad p\u00fablica, o se adopta una regulaci\u00f3n m\u00e1s estricta sobre el uso de pesticidas en la agricultura. Se trata de un momento esencial en la formaci\u00f3n de las pol\u00edticas p\u00fablicas, que suele consistir en que una persona investida de autoridad formal firme un decreto en una mesa ministerial, o en que un parlamento vote, con cierta solemnidad, la aprobaci\u00f3n de una norma.

Lo cuesti\u00f3n que se abre ante nosotros es qu\u00e9 pueden hacer, pero tambi\u00e9n c\u00f3mo y qui\u00e9n lo debe hacer, para que las soluciones, efectivamente, resuelvan los problemas. En este sentido, existen diversas herramientas y estrategias para \"hacer las cosas\", que se enmarcan en los diversos modelos de gesti\u00f3n p\u00fablica. Empezamos pregunt\u00e1ndonos d\u00f3nde estamos y por qu\u00e9 estamos donde estamos, haciendo un breve repaso a la evoluci\u00f3n hist\u00f3rica, desde la administraci\u00f3n p\u00fablica tradicional a la Nueva Gesti\u00f3n P\u00fablica. A continuaci\u00f3n, y ante los grandes retos que persisten, dedicamos la mayor parte de los v\u00eddeos a proponer una particular visi\u00f3n de la reforma que la administraci\u00f3n p\u00fablica requiere: la transici\u00f3n hacia un nuevo paradigma de gesti\u00f3n p\u00fablica relacional y deliberativa. El tipo de administraci\u00f3n que queremos no es una cuesti\u00f3n puramente instrumental (dar con el sistema que mejor \"funciona\") sino que tiene tambi\u00e9n un gran contenido ideol\u00f3gico: es una representaci\u00f3n de la sociedad en la que nos gustar\u00eda vivir.

Implementaci\u00f3n","3 hours to complete","En 1973 los profesores Pressman y Wildavsky publicaron el libro \"Implementaci\u00f3n\", con el sugerente y extenso subt\u00edtulo: \"C\u00f3mo las grandes expectativas de Washington se desvanecen en Oakland; o, por qu\u00e9 es asombroso que los programas federales lleguen siquiera a funcionar, siendo esto una epopeya de la Administraci\u00f3n de Desarrollo Econ\u00f3mico, contada por dos observadores solidarios que buscan levantar una moraleja sobre las ruinas de unas esperanzas frustradas\". El m\u00f3dulo 6 que presenta Raquel Gallego, sigue la estela de este libro y pone la atenci\u00f3n en una de las fases del ciclo de las pol\u00edticas menos visibles: el momento posterior a la decisi\u00f3n. Del dicho al hecho hay un gran trecho, dice el dicho -valga la redundancia-. No es suficiente haber decidido una cosa para que ocurra, y es posible que lo que ocurra sea distinto de lo que se hab\u00eda decidido.

As\u00ed que evaluar pol\u00edticas p\u00fablicas para determinar si resuelven los problemas sociales para los que han sido dise\u00f1adas tampoco parece la idea de un genio.

Si tan obvio es, \u00bfpor qu\u00e9 pervive la sensaci\u00f3n de que la evaluaci\u00f3n de pol\u00edticas es algo relativamente nuevo? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 persiste cierta percepci\u00f3n de que se eval\u00faa poco y mal? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 parece que, aunque se generen evidencias, estas no acaban de tener un papel influyente en el dise\u00f1o de las pol\u00edticas? Parte de la respuesta se halla en el mismo proceso de formaci\u00f3n de las pol\u00edticas p\u00fablicas que hemos estado estudiando estas semanas: la evaluaci\u00f3n aporta an\u00e1lisis racional a un proceso que no es puramente racional. Se basa en la l\u00f3gica de la resoluci\u00f3n de problemas, pero esta no es la \u00fanica l\u00f3gica en el tablero. El cient\u00edfico social generador y portador del conocimiento se ve obligado a interactuar con otros actores pol\u00edticos. El conocimiento es un recurso m\u00e1s en el juego, pero el conocimiento no es el juego. Existe, adem\u00e1s, una dificultad a\u00f1adida: determinar si una pol\u00edtica p\u00fablica tiene un impacto positivo sobre la necesidad o problema que le da raz\u00f3n de ser puede resultar m\u00e1s complicado de lo que parece.

We\u2019ll explore definitions of memory and consciousness as they relate to plants in asking whether we can say that plants might even be aware of their surroundings. This highly interdisciplinary course meshes historical studies with cutting edge modern research and will be relevant to all humans who seek their place in nature. This class has three main goals: 1. To introduce you to basic plant biology by exploring plant senses (sight, smell, hearing, touch, taste, balance). 2. To introduce you to biological research and the scientific method. 3.

They are the basis for the state-of-the-art methods in a wide variety of applications, such as medical diagnosis, image understanding, speech recognition, natural language processing, and many, many more. They are also a foundational tool in formulating many machine learning problems. This course is the first in a sequence of three. It describes the two basic PGM representations: Bayesian Networks, which rely on a directed graph; and Markov networks, which use an undirected graph. The course discusses both the theoretical properties of these representations as well as their use in practice.

In this course, we will be covering how to build a modern, greenfield serverless backend on AWS. Building brand new applications on AWS is a different task than lifting and shifting existing applications into AWS. When you have an existing application that you need to move to AWS, you might first look to using Amazon EC2 as your virtual machines, or maybe you might look into using docker containers and container hosting services like Amazon Elastic Container Service or Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service. Those are all great application hosting options, but in most cases, they still require you to have some kind of pulse on the underlying infrastructure hosting your application. \t`\n\nBuilding Modern Python Applications on AWS will explore how to build an API driven application using Amazon API Gateway for serverless API hosting, AWS Lambda for serverless computing, and Amazon Cognito for serverless authentication. We will follow an API driven development process and first mock up what the API will look like. We will cover all the ins and outs of the service Amazon API Gateway, and as you\u2019ll learn- it does a lot more than just hosting an API. \n\nThen we will add authentication to the API using Amazon Cognito. You\u2019ll learn about how the authorization flow works with Cognito, and how to build it into your APIs. From there, we will add a Lambda backend that will be triggered by API Gateway. The lambda functions will be using the AWS SDKs to perform various data processing tasks. You\u2019ll learn about the different configurations that exist for Lambda, and we will show you how to create and manage lambda functions. Some of the features of our API will require multiple lambda functions to execute in a specific order, like a workflow, and we will use AWS Step Functions to create a serverless workflow. Finally, we will talk about how to optimize your APIs at every layer using AWS features.\n\nNote: There are three versions of this class, \"Building Modern Node.js Applications on AWS\" for Node.js developers, \"Building Modern Python Applications on AWS\" for Python developers, and \"Building Modern Java Applications on AWS\" for Java developers.

What makes an argument convincing? How to establish your argument in such a way that there is no possible room for doubt left? How mathematical thinking can help with this? In this week we will start digging into these questions. We will see how a small remark or a simple observation can turn a seemingly non-trivial question into an obvious one. Through various examples we will observe a parallel between constructing a rigorous argument and mathematical reasoning."]],[["How to Find an Example?","6 hours to complete","How can we be certain that an object with certain requirements exist? One way to show this, is to go through all objects and check whether at least one of them meets the requirements. However, in many cases, the search space is enormous. A computer may help, but some reasoning that narrows the search space is important both for computer search and for \"bare hands\" work. In this module, we will learn various techniques for showing that an object exists and that an object is optimal among all other objects. As usual, we'll practice solving many interactive puzzles. We'll show also some computer programs that help us to construct an example."]],[["Recursion and Induction","7 hours to complete","We'll discover two powerful methods of defining objects, proving concepts, and implementing programs \u2014 recursion and induction. These two methods are heavily used in discrete mathematics and computer science. In particular, you will see them frequently in algorithms \u2014 for analysing correctness and running time of algorithms as well as for implementing efficient solutions. For some computational problems (e.g., exploring networks), recursive solutions are the most natural ones. The main idea of recursion and induction is to decompose a given problem into smaller problems of the same type. Being able to see such decompositions is an important skill both in mathematics and in programming. We'll hone this skill by solving various problems together."]],[["Logic","4 hours to complete","We have already invoked mathematical logic when we discussed how to make convincing arguments by giving examples. This week we will turn mathematical logic full on. We will discuss its basic operations and rules. We will see how logic can play a crucial and indispensable role in creating convincing arguments. We will discuss how to construct a negation to the statement, and you will see  how to win an argument by showing your opponent is wrong with just one example called counterexample!. We will see tricky and seemingly counterintuitive, but yet (an unintentional pun) logical aspects of mathematical logic. We will see one of the oldest approaches to making convincing arguments: Reductio ad Absurdum."]],[["Invariants","4 hours to complete","\"There are things that never change\". Apart from being just a philosophical statement, this phrase turns out to be an important idea that can actually help. In this module we will see how it can help in problem solving. Things that do not change are called invariants in mathematics. They form an important tool of proving with numerous applications, including estimating running time of programs and algorithms. We will get some intuition of what they are, see how they can look like, and get some practice in using them."]],[["Solving a 15-Puzzle","13 hours to complete","In this module, we consider a well known 15-puzzle where one needs to restore order among 15 square pieces in a square box. It turns out that the behaviour of this puzzle is determined by mathematics: it is solvable if and only if the corresponding permutation is even. We will learn the basic properties of even and odd permutations. The task is to implement a program that determines whether a permutation is even or odd. There is also a more difficult bonus task: to implement a program that actually computes a solution (sequence of moves) for a given position assuming that this position is solvable."]]],"about":"Mathematical thinking is crucial in all areas of computer science: algorithms, bioinformatics, computer graphics, data science, machine learning, etc. In this course, we will learn the most important tools used in discrete mathematics: induction, recursion, logic, invariants, examples, optimality.

Do each of these objects meet the given requirements?In the course, we use a try-this-before-we-explain-everything approach: you will be solving many interactive (and mobile friendly) puzzles that were carefully designed to allow you to invent many of the important ideas and concepts yourself.\n\nPrerequisites: \n1. We assume only basic math (e.g., we expect you to know what is a square or how to add fractions), common sense and curiosity. \n2.

We\u2019ll see what happens to the idea of Mindfulness when we make it into something that can be measured, and then we\u2019ll investigate some of the most popular (and effective) Mindfulness-based Interventions, such as MBSR and MBCT.

Rather than being seen as mystical practices from ancient Buddhism or esoteric philosophy, they are increasingly seen as technologies rooted in evidence from psychology and neuroscience.  Mindfulness has become the basis for numerous therapeutic interventions, both as a treatment in healthcare and as a means of enhancing well-being and happiness.  For millions around the world, mindfulness has become a life-style choice, enhancing and enriching everyday experience. Mindfulness is big business.But, what actually is mindfulness?  Is it really good for you?  Can anyone learn it?  How can you recognize charlatans? Would you want to live in a mindful society, and would it smell like sandalwood?  What does it feel like to be mindful?  Are you mindful already, and how would you know?\n\nEvolving from the popular Honours Academy course at Leiden University, this innovative course combines conventional scholarly inquiry from multiple disciplines (ranging from psychology, through philosophy, to politics) with experiential learning (including specially designed \u2018meditation labs,\u2019 in which you\u2019ll get chance to practice and analyze mindfulness on yourself).  In the end, the course aims to provide a responsible, comprehensive, and inclusive education about (and in) mindfulness as a contemporary phenomenon.\n\nDuring the production of this course, we have been supported by Willem Kuyken, Director of the University of Oxford Mindfulness Centre, and Stephen Batchelor, co-founder of Bodhi College.  And we gratefully acknowledge the contributions made by Mark Williams, co-developer of Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), and Rebecca Crane, Director of the Centre for Mindfulness Research and Practice at the University of Bangor.\n\n\"The course enabled me to explore the mindfulness construct at its deeper lever from philosophical, psychological and political lenses.

Two of the most prevalent options are Docker and Kubernetes - each with its own distinct set of features. Regardless of which technology you choose, one of the biggest challenges with containers is their orchestration. Unlike traditional, monolithic applications where you can only scale at a macro level - an executable, for example - containerized applications scale at the container level. When coupled with a microservices approach, each container can contain the code necessary to execute a single task or function. While this provides a number of benefits, a single application can consist of hundreds of containerized microservices. How do you handle starting, stopping, scaling out and scaling in all of these containers?\n\nAWS offers a number of services that help with container orchestration, including Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), Amazon Lightsail, and Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR). Throughout this course, expert instructors will dive deep into these services as well as general container technologies and capabilities.\n\nThis course uses a combination of video-based lectures, delivered by AWS technical trainers, demonstrations, and hands-on lab exercises to enable you to deploy and manage a containerized application.","instructors":[{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/instructor\/~41700785","learners":"47,379","courses":"6","rate":"4.55\/5","rate_count":"41","name":"Seph Robinson"},{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/instructor\/~37505720","learners":"208,446","courses":"6","rate":"4.55\/5","rate_count":"41","name":"Morgan WillisTop Instructor"},{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/instructor\/~50319007","learners":"9,462","courses":"1","rate":"4.55\/5","rate_count":"41","name":"Scott Malkie"},{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/instructor\/~47491589","learners":"9,462","courses":"1","rate":"4.55\/5","rate_count":"41","name":"Alana Layton"},{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/instructor\/~39338524","learners":"68,553","courses":"5","rate":"4.55\/5","rate_count":"41","name":"Rick Hurst"}],"language":"English"},"big-history":{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/big-history","skill_gain":[],"syl_small":[[["Big History, Critical Thinking, & Transdisciplinarity","4 hours to complete","Welcome to Big History!

TD learning combines some of the features of both Monte Carlo and Dynamic Programming (DP) methods. TD methods are similar to Monte Carlo methods in that they can learn from the agent\u2019s interaction with the world, and do not require knowledge of the model. TD methods are similar to DP methods in that they bootstrap, and thus can learn online---no waiting until the end of an episode. You will see how TD can learn more efficiently than Monte Carlo, due to bootstrapping. For this module, we first focus on TD for prediction, and discuss TD for control in the next module. This week, you will implement TD to estimate the value function for a fixed policy, in a simulated domain.

First, we will discuss how to correctly interpret p-values, effect sizes, confidence intervals, Bayes Factors, and likelihood ratios, and how these statistics answer different questions you might be interested in. Then, you will learn how to design experiments where the false positive rate is controlled, and how to decide upon the sample size for your study, for example in order to achieve high statistical power. Subsequently, you will learn how to interpret evidence in the scientific literature given widespread publication bias, for example by learning about p-curve analysis. Finally, we will talk about how to do philosophy of science, theory construction, and cumulative science, including how to perform replication studies, why and how to pre-register your experiment, and how to share your results following Open Science principles. In practical, hands on assignments, you will learn how to simulate t-tests to learn which p-values you can expect, calculate likelihood ratio's and get an introduction the binomial Bayesian statistics, and learn about the positive predictive value which expresses the probability published research findings are true. We will experience the problems with optional stopping and learn how to prevent these problems by using sequential analyses. You will calculate effect sizes, see how confidence intervals work through simulations, and practice doing a-priori power analyses. Finally, you will learn how to examine whether the null hypothesis is true using equivalence testing and Bayesian statistics, and how to pre-register a study, and share your data on the Open Science Framework.\n\nAll videos now have Chinese subtitles.

Albums are made in bedrooms as well as studios. On the surface this is liberating. Anyone can make an album for the low cost of a couple pieces of gear and a software package. But, if you dig deeper, you will find that it is not so easy. Producing music requires knowledge, dedication, and creativity.\n    \nKnowledge is where this course comes in. No matter what kind of music you are making, there is a large set of tools that you will need to use.  Each lesson of this course will demonstrate a different set of music production tools, loosely following along the music production process of recording, editing, and mixing. \n\nWe will start with some background on the nature of sound and how we perceive it. We will then examine the components necessary to record audio into a computer, so that you understand the devices that sound must travel through in a music production process. \n    \nOnce recorded, sound must be organized along a timeline, a process known as editing. It allows us to give the impression of perfect performances and create many of the sounds we hear in contemporary music. The contemporary editing tool is the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW),  a piece of software that stores and organizes all the assets of a musical project. We will focus on the editing tools that are essential in contemporary music production and that all DAWs provide. \n\nAfter editing, sounds must be combined or mixed together, so we look to the mixing board\u2014a very creative place if you know how to use it. We will explore the basic functionality of both hardware and software mixing boards, including volume, pan, mute, solo, busses, inserts, sends, and submixes. The mixing process, however, includes more tools than the mixing board provides on its own. Sound must also be processed, modified from its recorded state to fit the context of the music. We will look at compression, equalization, and delay, and examine the many audio effects that are offshoots of these devices and how they are used in a musical context.\n    \nIn the end, the music production process relies on your creativity. Creativity is a product of the mind and will stay there, unexpressed, until the right tools are used in the right way to share it with the world. If you have an idea in your head, it will take numerous steps, each with an important tool, to reach your audience. You bring the dedication and creativity, and this course will bring you the knowledge to make that happen.","instructors":[{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/instructor\/loudon-stearns","learners":"113,539","courses":"9","rate":"4.83\/5","rate_count":"63","name":"Loudon Stearns"}],"language":"English"},"intro-programming":{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/intro-programming","skill_gain":["Computer Programming","Algorithms","Programming Language","Scratch (Programming Language)"],"syl_small":[[["Your First Computer Program","3 hours to complete","In this unit you\u2019ll create your very first computer program!

During this lecture, we will discuss how neurons assign values to different options during the decision-making process. We will also discuss the central role of the nucleus accumbens and orbitofrontal cortex in the valuation process. To make adaptive decisions, we must evaluate the costs and benefits of available options. Neuroeconomics has set itself the ambitious goal of understanding the brain mechanisms that are responsible for these evaluative processes. Neuroeconomics has also focused on describing the neural signals related to learning the value of stimuli and actions. Overall, this lecture will present some key ideas of Neuroeconomics. "]],[["Affective Mechanisms of Decision-Making ","4 hours to complete","The influence of emotions on decision-making is largely ignored in decision theories. Our objective in this lecture is to explore the role of emotion in decision-making and to introduce theories and basic findings of Neuroeconomics in this context. For example, the neuroeconomic studies of decision-making in neurological patients who can no longer process emotional information normally suggest that people make judgments based not only on evaluations of the values of options and probabilities of outcomes but often primarily on emotions."]],[["Dual Process Theory of Decision-Making: Toward a Neuroeconomics Perspective","2 hours to complete","Studies in Neuroeconomics have found evidence suggesting that the brain may employ multiple levels of processing when making decisions, and this conclusion is consistent with dual-processing theories that have received extensive theoretical consideration in the field of cognitive psychology. During this lecture, we will discuss the classic and cutting-edge research studies supporting dual process theory. Additionally, I recommend you to attend the guest lecture provided by Dr. Samuel McClure (Arizona State University), who is a leading neuroeconomist investigating dual-process mechanisms."]],[["Decision-Making under Risk: Toward a Neuroeconomics Mechanism","4 hours to complete","Many of our decisions involve uncertainty or imperfect knowledge about how our choices lead to outcomes. The important aspect of uncertainty most commonly considered by economists and neuroeconomists is risk, which refers to situations in which we know the probabilities of possible outcomes. For example, if you play roulette in Monte Carlo, you are making a decision under risk since you know the probability of winning and thus how much you should expect to lose. Here I will introduce a neuroeconomic approach to studying decisions under risk and an anticipatory affect model suggesting that the balance of activity in the set brain areas (insular cortex and nucleus accumbens) promotes either approach toward or avoidance of risk. Additionally, Dr. Brian Knutson (Stanford University) provides his comments on the functional role of the nucleus accumbens in a guest lecture."]],[["The Social Brain: Games in the Brain","2 hours to complete","Ancient Greek philosophers observed that we are fundamentally a social species. Indeed, the human brain has evolved to deal with complex social interactions. Day by day, we collectively analyze problems or situations and evaluate alternative courses of action within social groups. Game theory has proven useful in the investigation of the neural basis of social interactions and social decision-making. In particular, researchers have investigated what happens in the brains of subjects involved in games where each player can choose between cooperative and non-cooperative behaviors or between altruistic and selfish behaviors. Here we will apply game theory to studying the neural mechanism of decisions to cooperate or to defect. I will also introduce the mirror neurons mechanism of social interaction."]],[[" Evolutionary Perspective of Decision-Making ","6 hours to complete","Neuroeconomics investigates the origins of human decision-making by examining whether similar choice biases are seen in nonhuman primates, our closest phylogenetic relatives.

How are some genes activated and others are silenced? How is this controlled? The answer is epigenetics.  Epigenetics has been a hot topic for research over the past decade as it has become clear that aberrant epigenetic control contributes to disease (particularly to cancer). Epigenetic alterations are heritable through cell division, and in some instances are able to behave similarly to mutations in terms of their stability. Importantly, unlike genetic mutations, epigenetic modifications are reversible and therefore have the potential to be manipulated therapeutically. It has also become clear in recent years that epigenetic modifications are sensitive to the environment (for example diet), which has sparked a large amount of public debate and research.\n\nThis course will give an introduction to the fundamentals of epigenetic control. We will examine epigenetic phenomena that are manifestations of epigenetic control in several organisms, with a focus on mammals. We will examine the interplay between epigenetic control and the environment and finally the role of aberrant epigenetic control in disease.\n\nAll necessary information will be covered in the lectures, and recommended and required readings will be provided.

Because financial planning is such a personal topic, you will be encouraged to define your own financial goals and objectives while we discuss concepts and provide tools which can be applied in helping you reach those goals.Within each module, you will view a combination of traditional lecture style videos along with video vignettes that introduce financial topics for discussion among participants. The video vignettes provide a unique and exciting component to this course. Each vignette introduces a real-world scenario where financial decisions must be made and financial planning concepts can be applied. You will be challenged to think critically about each scenario and decide how you might come to a resolution if ever faced with a similar situation.\n\nFinally, the course also includes material throughout which is focused on career opportunities in financial planning, including video interviews with actual CFP\u00ae professionals and other professionals working in this exciting and growing career area. The final module in the class is devoted to the topic of financial planning as a career.","instructors":[{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/instructor\/nicholas-paulson","learners":"41,538","courses":"1","rate":"4.56\/5","rate_count":"67","name":"Nicholas Paulson"},{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/instructor\/kathy-sweedler","learners":"41,538","courses":"1","rate":"4.56\/5","rate_count":"67","name":"Kathryn L.

The first task in carrying out a research study is to define the research question and express it as a testable hypothesis. With examples from the media, you\u2019ll see what does and does not work in this regard, giving you a chance to define a research question from some real news stories."]],[["Types of Variables, Common Distributions and Sampling","4 hours to complete","This module will introduce you to some of the key building blocks of knowledge in statistical analysis: types of variables, common distributions and sampling. You\u2019ll see the difference between \u201cwell-behaved\u201d data distributions, such as the normal and the Poisson, and real-world ones that are common in public health data sets."]],[["Introduction to R and RStudio","3 hours to complete","Now it\u2019s time to get started with the powerful and completely free statistical software R and its popular interface RStudio. With the example of fruit and vegetable consumption, you\u2019ll learn how to download R, import the data set and run essential descriptive analyses to get to know the variables."]],[["Hypothesis Testing in R","5 hours to complete","Having learned how to define a research question and testable hypothesis earlier in the course, you\u2019ll learn how to apply hypothesis testing in R and interpret the result. As all medical knowledge is derived from a sample of patients, random and other kinds of variation mean that what you measure on that sample, such as the average body mass index, is not necessarily the same as in the population as a whole. It\u2019s essential that you incorporate this uncertainty in your estimate of average BMI when presenting it. This involves the calculation of a p value and confidence interval, fundamental concepts in statistical analysis. You\u2019ll see how to do this for averages and proportions."]]],"about":"Welcome to Introduction to Statistics & Data Analysis in Public Health!This course will teach you the core building blocks of statistical analysis - types of variables, common distributions, hypothesis testing - but, more than that, it will enable you to take a data set you've never seen before, describe its keys features, get to know its strengths and quirks, run some vital basic analyses and then formulate and test hypotheses based on means and proportions. You'll then have a solid grounding to move on to more sophisticated analysis and take the other courses in the series. You'll learn the popular, flexible and completely free software R, used by statistics and machine learning practitioners everywhere. It's hands-on, so you'll first learn about how to phrase a testable hypothesis via examples of medical research as reported by the media. Then you'll work through a data set on fruit and vegetable eating habits: data that are realistically messy, because that's what public health data sets are like in reality. There will be mini-quizzes with feedback along the way to check your understanding. The course will sharpen your ability to think critically and not take things for granted: in this age of uncontrolled algorithms and fake news, these skills are more important than ever.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nSome formulae are given to aid understanding, but this is not one of those courses where you need a mathematics degree to follow it. You will need only basic numeracy (for example, we will not use calculus) and familiarity with graphical and tabular ways of presenting results. No knowledge of R or programming is assumed.","instructors":[{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/instructor\/alexbottle","learners":"26,763","courses":"6","rate":"4.73\/5","rate_count":"135","name":"Alex Bottle"}],"language":"English"},"tricky-american-english-pronunciation":{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/tricky-american-english-pronunciation","skill_gain":[],"syl_small":[[["Welcome","21 minutes to complete","In this course, you will learn about the consonant and vowel sounds of American English and practice some of the difficult sounds.

We will explore whether and how international criminal justice contribute to what UN Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon called the \u2018age of accountability\u2019. The theory is, those who commit the worst of human crimes, are held accountable, whether they are rank-and-file foot soldiers or military commanders, whether they are lowly civil servants following orders or top political leaders. We will test  how this can be done and if this is realistic.\n\nDuring this course, you will be offered a look into the \u2018kitchen\u2019 of the Hague international criminal courts and tribunals. You will learn how international criminal justice functions, who the actors are, what outcomes it produces, and how it can be improved. \n\nIf you want to gain a better understanding of international criminal cases, like the Lubanga case, the ICC\u2019s first ever trial, and the legal legacy of UN international criminal tribunals, then this course is definitely for you!\n\nThis course is free to join and to participate in. There is the possibility to get a verified certificate for the course, which is a paid option.

Shocked by economic assumptions of human behavior as self-centered and focusing only on what can be measured? Asking yourself if there are no sensible economic alternatives to free markets? Then you are at the right place to learn economics! This is the first online course that teaches economics from a pluralist perspective. Economic pluralism means that a plurality of theoretical and methodological viewpoints is regarded as valuable in itself and is simply the best way in which economics can make progress in understanding the world. This MOOC will illustrate economic pluralism not only in substance but also in form. You will see not only me, a Professor of Economics, but also a pop-up Prof of our business school, who illustrates the actor perspective of firms, government and civil society. And you will meet an online student, based in Greece, who will help you through the tutorial videos in which I will explain key concepts, tools and techniques. \n\nI will not limit myself to the dominant theory, as almost every other course does. Instead, I will introduce you to four very different economic theories for the whole set of standard topics in microeconomics and macroeconomics. The theories are presented every time from broad and more interdisciplinary to narrow and more mathematical. The four theories that I like to introduce you to are Social Economics, Institutional Economics, Post Keynesian economics and, at the very end of each topic, Neoclassical Economics, for the special case of ideally functioning markets. But not everything is different in this course. Like every economics course, it includes numbers, diagrams, tables, equations, and some calculations. \n\nWhy would you go through the effort of learning the basics of four theories instead of one? Because it will help you to see why many economists cannot predict crises, whereas others can see signals but are often not being listened to because they do not belong to the dominant school of thought. It will also enable you to see that it is just one theory claiming economic agents to be self-centered and focusing on the measurable only. Other economic theories go well beyond these limitations. And, finally, the pluralist approach will provide you with policy alternatives to neoliberalist policies promoting free markets. \n\nThe objective of this course is twofold. First, to enable you to understand different economic viewpoints, linked to important traditions in economic thought, and basic economic concepts belonging to these theoretical perspectives. Second, to enable you to do some basic economic calculations that are important in economic life, such as calculating an inflation rate, and in economic policies, such as estimating the rough gains from trade for both trading partners, and in economic arguments, such as in calculating utility maximization with given prices and budgets.\n\nI hope you will enjoy the course!","instructors":[{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/instructor\/~17291124","learners":"34,866","courses":"1","rate":"4.91\/5","rate_count":"26","name":"Irene van Staveren"},{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/instructor\/~22526066","learners":"55,745","courses":"5","rate":"4.91\/5","rate_count":"26","name":"Rob van Tulder"},{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/instructor\/~22745556","learners":"34,866","courses":"1","rate":"4.91\/5","rate_count":"26","name":"Maria Dafnomili"}],"language":"English"},"ecology-conservation":{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/ecology-conservation","skill_gain":[],"syl_small":[[["Can an Ecosystem Recover?","2 hours to complete","We begin in Gorongosa National Park, Mozambique, and pose the question: Can this ecosystem recover after a 15-year civil war?

Design is becoming a capability-enhancing skill, equipping people with the ability to deal with uncertainty, complexity and failure. In this course, we demonstrate how you can use design as a way of thinking to provide strategic and innovative advantage within your profession. Suitable for anyone who is curious about design and translating the processes and tools of design thinking into innovative opportunities, over 5 weeks we explore, apply and practice the design process: think, make, break and repeat.\n\nThrough introducing theoretical concepts and examining industry case studies with leading Australian design firms, we investigate design as learning about the context (the thinking part), building prototypes as tangible representations (the making part) and testing potential solutions (the breaking part). We build on this by showing the productive value of moving through the process quickly and often (the repeating part), to improve ideas and develop new insights. \n\nThroughout the course, you will follow us through three of Australia\u2019s most exciting design offices and learn from practicing designers and leaders in design. This insight into industry will enable you to develop a comprehensive understanding of design and the role it can and does play within the innovation landscape.

SDT details how the styles and strategies of motivators such as parents, teachers, coaches, managers, and health-care professionals can promote or undermine engagement and the positive consequences that follow from it. In this course, Professor Richard Ryan, co-founder of the theory, will provide an overview of SDT with special emphasis on how autonomy, competence, and relatedness supports and facilitates behavioral persistence, quality of relationships, and healthy developmental processes, among other topics. He will also discuss the convergence of behavioral phenomenological and neuropsychological aspects of autonomy within SDT research. In addition, he will illustrate practical applications of SDT, with emphasis on educational, work, sport, healthcare and psychotherapy settings.","instructors":[{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/instructor\/richard-ryan","learners":"25,027","courses":"1","rate":"4.82\/5","rate_count":"39","name":"Richard Ryan"}],"language":"English"},"change-management":{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/change-management","skill_gain":[],"syl_small":[[["Re-imagining change 1: The change problem","4 hours to complete","\u2018We can\u2019t solve a problem with the same type of thinking that we used in creating it.\u2019 \u2013\u2013 Albert Einstein             Einstein was onto something!

In an open society, everyone should be allowed to participate on an equal footing. No one should be excluded. Equally, human rights should be enjoyed by all people and discrimination is prohibited. Yet, even in an open society, universality of human rights and the prohibition of discrimination may raise many questions. For example, what about the rights of people who are not (yet) citizens of that society, such as asylum seekers? On the one hand, asylum seekers find themselves in the extremely difficult and vulnerable position of being in transit. For that reason, their needs deserve extra consideration. For example, they may need special protection against hostile responses by the local population, they may need food, education and housing, and they must be protected against discrimination. On the other hand, not being citizens, the question is often raised to what extent they should be included and benefit from the rights and freedoms guaranteed in the European Convention on Human Rights. Finding the right balance and solving such dilemmas is crucial in open societies. In this week, we focus on (1) the rights and freedoms of insiders and outsiders under the European Convention, (2) non-discrimination and (3) the protection of vulnerable groups.

Together, these rights provide the essential conditions for the free and peaceful sharing of thoughts and ideas. Nevertheless, the unlimited freedom to say whatever you want and the freedom to protest might also undermine the openness of society. Hate speech and discriminatory speech, for example, might contribute to the exclusion of minority groups.

You will learn by doing.\n\nHere is a link to a TRAILER for the course. To view the trailer, please copy and paste the link into your browser.\nhttps:\/\/vimeo.com\/382067900\/b78b800dc0\n\nLearner review: \"Love the approach Professor Wheeler takes towards this course. It's to the point, easy to follow, and very informative! Would definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested in taking a Screenplay Writing course!\n\nThe course curriculum is simple: We will adopt a professional writers room process in which you\u2019ll write, post your work for peer review, share feedback with your peers and revise your work with the feedback you receive from your peers. That's how we do it in the real world. You will feel as if you were in a professional writers room yet no prior experience as a writer is required. I'm a proponent of Experiential Learning (Active Learning). My lectures are short (sometimes just two minutes long) and to the point, designed in a step-by-step process essential to your success as a script writer. I will guide you but I won\u2019t \"show\" you how to write.

Learning the form of people is of great interest to us \u2013 physicians, nurses, physician assistants, emergency medical services personnel and many, many others.\n\nLearning anatomy classically involved dissection of the deceased whether directly in the laboratory or from texts, drawings, photographs or videos.  There are many wonderful resources for the study of anatomy.  Developing an understanding of the human form requires significant work and a wide range of resources.\n\nIn this course, we have attempted to present succinct videos of human anatomy.  Some will find these images to be disturbing and these images carry a need to respect the individual who decided to donate their remains to benefit our teaching and learning.\n\nAll of the dissections depicted in the following videos are from individuals who gave their remains to be used in the advancement of medical education and research after death to the Yale School of Medicine.\n\nThe sequence of videos is divided into classic anatomic sections.  Each video has a set of learning objectives and a brief quiz at the end.  Following each section there is another quiz covering the entire section in order for you to test your knowledge.  \n\nWe hope these videos will help you better understand the human form, make time that you may have in the laboratory more worthwhile if you have that opportunity and help you develop an appreciation of the wonderful intricacies of people.\n\nANATOMY OF THE CHEST, ABDOMEN, AND PELVIS WAS PRODUCED IN PART DUE TO THE GENEROUS FUNDING OF THE DAVID F.

This week, we distinguish between simple, complicated and complex problems. Social innovation takes place in complex systems and complex systems have complex or \u201cwicked\u201d  problems, like the kinds of problems the world is trying to tackle right now such as climate change, HIV Aids and other pandemics, poverty and inequality. A complex system has many variables or elements such as different sorts of people, material and rules and those elements of the system are interacting with each other so much that the complexity increases exponentially. So the work of complexity is about bringing yourself into the system, engaging with it, living with it and innovating in yourself as you innovate in that system that you\u2019re working in. You can\u2019t look at the whole system but you can look at more than one piece of it. The more you start to bring in different parts of the systems, you can then start to connect those in ways that they weren\u2019t connected before.

There\u2019s transformative power in shifting from looking at needs, gaps, and what\u2019s wrong, to appreciating strengths, resources and what\u2019s right. Through developing a strength-based mindset and an appreciative approach you can discover hidden or underused resources. These resources might be people, kinds of knowledge and expertise, time, and physical spaces. As soon as you start seeing resources all around you, not only can you move forward but you become energised and hopeful, and creative things start to happen. You\u2019ll find that you might be a lot richer than you think in terms of what you have to start building your own social innovation with."]],[["Getting out of your comfort zone","3 hours to complete","By nature the world of social innovation is made of crossing boundaries, bringing together different actors, resources, spaces, but it can be overwhelming. Part of our challenge on the journey to becoming changemakers is to learn how to become comfortable with discomfort and how in the social innovation space where you take yourself into spaces and you surround yourself with people that you normally do not engage with. Understanding how we define differences using cultural, sociological, psychological and spiritual lenses and what the nature of the differences is helps to develop tools for getting out of your comfort zone. It takes a little bit of courage because it makes you uncomfortable, but that\u2019s how you build the competencies, the personal resilience to engage with difference when we do go and drive for innovations or we look to make differences in communities that are unlike us or operate in a different way. "]],[["Innovating by design","5 hours to complete","A number of methodologies and processes can help generate ideas and creative opportunities, and some of these have been used in business to generate new products and services, and are starting to be applied in social innovation. Human-centred design is incredibly important, and the Design Thinking process allows you to start early and wherever you are with whatever you\u2019ve got. Design Thinking has evolved as a way to respond to deeper user insights, to connect more with people and with communities so that we can actually design solutions that are human-centred. Design Thinking is not just about products, but also helps create new processes, new systems, new services, and importantly even user experiences. Following a Design Thinking process will help you iterate and test your solution with end users, with an emphasis on failing early and often through trying things out and prototyping. Powerful Design Thinking methodology can help you to come up with human-centred design solutions that manifest economic viability, technical feasibility and social desirability in your social innovation.  "]],[["Changing the system - who me?","3 hours to complete","Understanding that social innovation is system innovation can help us appreciate why social innovation is so difficult to do. Social innovations can start to challenge and change the underlying system conditions that caused the social or environmental problem in the first place. We are asked to innovate around belief systems, or around authority, power, and resource flows. So, a social innovation challenges the rules of the game. Asking what\u2019s innovative about the work means asking questions around the experiences of where an innovation might be changing the rules of the games and allows us to go deeper into the kinds of impacts that might be possible, and discover hidden impacts. When any kind of social innovation starts to get at the systemic roots, we\u2019re going to be provoking anxiety. So it\u2019s quite helpful to map out the social system and the rules that govern it and then to consider how you are challenging these rules through the innovation.

As social innovations mature, the forms they could take and the multiple ways in which you could organise around achieving impact increase. It used to be easy to label organisations according to non-profit and for profit, and government institutions based on their purpose, its organisational structure and the way it measured what it achieved. That\u2019s all changing.

Even the most sophisticated statistical analyses are not useful to a business if they do not lead to actionable advice, or if the answers to those business questions are not conveyed in a way that non-technical people can understand.  In this course you will learn how to become a master at communicating business-relevant implications of data analyses.  By the end, you will know how to structure your data analysis projects to ensure the fruits of your hard labor yield results for your stakeholders.  You will also know how to streamline your analyses and highlight their implications efficiently using visualizations in Tableau, the most popular visualization program in the business world.  Using other Tableau features, you will be able to make effective visualizations that harness the human brain\u2019s innate perceptual and cognitive tendencies to convey conclusions directly and clearly.  Finally, you will be practiced in designing and persuasively presenting business \u201cdata stories\u201d that use these visualizations, capitalizing on business-tested methods and design principles.","instructors":[{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/instructor\/daniel-egger","learners":"764,715","courses":"8","rate":"4.77\/5","rate_count":"151","name":"Daniel Egger"},{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/instructor\/jana-schaich-borg","learners":"578,226","courses":"6","rate":"4.77\/5","rate_count":"151","name":"Jana Schaich Borg"}],"language":"English"},"introduction-to-computer-programming":{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/introduction-to-computer-programming","skill_gain":[],"syl_small":[[["Your development environment","9 hours to complete","In this topic you will learn about three key concepts: \u2022\tThe toolkit we will use to develop programs.\u2022\tDrawing using simple shapes and 2D coordinates.\u2022\tThe process and experience of writing code."]],[["Drawing in 2D","4 hours to complete","In this topic you will learn about three key concepts: \u2022\tSet of 2D drawing functions in p5.js  \u2022\tColour representation and styles  \u2022\tDebugging with the console"]],[["Variables, objects and interaction","7 hours to complete","In this topic you will learn about three concepts: \u2022\tVariables and data\u2022\tSimple interaction\n\u2022\tCode organisation"]]],"about":"This MOOC provides you with the foundational skill set required to write computer programs.

We identify what is meant when we say that something is a system and we narrow down the very broad definitions to focus on the human-made or modified systems that are our focus in systems engineering. We then look at the broad phases and activities that a system moves through during its life cycle, from early identification of the need for the system, exploration of options, functional design, physical design, detailed design and development, construction and production, utilization and support and then, finally, retirement.

How do they need to inter-relate? Can we source these subsystems off the shelf or do they need to be designed from the ground up? These are key questions of preliminary design. For the subsystems that need to be designed or modified, some level of detailed design will be required. We will look at detailed design process and talk about tools like prototyping and how these tools help to refine the detailed design.

Whilst we have used what is generally referred to as a waterfall approach throughout the course to explain systems engineering, in this module we also briefly introduce alternatives such as incremental and evolutionary development. We conclude the module by emphasising the importance of planning throughout the systems engineering program and the development of a governing plan known as the systems engineering management plan or SEMP.

This course is designed for people with some technical competencies who would like more than a \"cookbook\" approach, but who still need to concentrate on the routine sorts of presentation and analysis that deepen the understanding of our professional topics. \n\nIn practical Time Series Analysis we look at data sets that represent sequential information, such as stock prices, annual rainfall, sunspot activity, the price of agricultural products, and more.  We look at several mathematical models that might be used to describe the processes which generate these types of data. We also look at graphical representations that provide insights into our data. Finally, we also learn how to make forecasts that say intelligent things about what we might expect in the future.\n\nPlease take a few minutes to explore the course site. You will find video lectures with supporting written materials as well as quizzes to help emphasize important points. The language for the course is R, a free implementation of the S language. It is a professional environment and fairly easy to learn.\n\nYou can discuss material from the course with your fellow learners.

The income produced by this family is reinvested in more art that, when marketed well, builds a larger, even more diverse family. When this cycle repeats year after year, the organization incrementally and sustainably builds capacity, presence, and health. Following the introductory lectures, you will learn more about the Cycle by reading the executive summary, reviewing answers to frequently asked questions, and completing an introductory quiz.

Kaiser and President Brett Egan, this course will introduce you to a management theory called the Cycle which supports thriving arts and cultural organizations. Learning from our work with managers from over 80 countries around the world, the DeVos Institute developed the Cycle as a simple, but powerful tool to assist managers in their effort to respond to an increasingly complex environment and propel their institutions to excellence. The Cycle explains how great art and strong marketing can create a family of supporters, who in turn help the organization produce the revenue required to support even more great art the next year. The Institute has seen the Cycle work in performing and presenting organizations, as well as museums, arts schools, and other nonprofit endeavors like service organizations, historical societies, public libraries, university programs, advocacy organizations, botanical gardens, and zoos.\n\nBy taking this course, you will learn: \n\n\u2022 the importance of bold, exciting, and mission-driven programming in an organization; \n\u2022 how long-term artistic planning can help an organization produce this work; \n\u2022 how an organization can aggressively market that programming and the institution behind it to develop a family of supporters - including ticket buyers, board members, donors, trustees and volunteers; \n\u2022 how an organization can cultivate and steward this family to build a healthy base of earned and contributed income; and \n\u2022 how an organization can reinvest that income into increasingly ambitious programming year after year.\n\nAll course material is available upon enrollment for self-paced learners.

Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximines made bold proposals about the ultimate constituents of reality, while Heraclitus insisted that there is an underlying order to the changing world.  Parmenides of Elea formulated a powerful objection to all these proposals, while later Greek theorists (such as Anaxagoras and the atomist Democritus) attempted to answer that objection.  In fifth-century Athens, Socrates insisted on the importance of the fundamental ethical question\u2014\u201cHow shall I live?\u201d\u2014and his pupil, Plato, and Plato\u2019s pupil, Aristotle, developed elaborate philosophical systems to explain the nature of reality, knowledge, and human happiness.

How do people manage to design these complicated chips?  Answer: a sequence of computer aided design (CAD) tools takes an abstract description of the chip, and refines it step-wise to a final design. This class focuses on the major design tools used in the creation of an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) or System on Chip (SoC) design. Our focus in this first part of the course is on key Boolean logic representations that make it possible to synthesize, and to verify, the gate-level logic in these designs.  This is the first step of the design chain, as we move from logic to layout.    Our goal is for students to understand how the tools themselves work, at the level of their fundamental algorithms and data structures. Topics covered will include: Computational Boolean algebra, logic verification, and logic synthesis (2-level and multi-level).Recommended Background\nProgramming experience (C, C++, Java, Python, etc.) and basic knowledge of data structures and algorithms (especially recursive algorithms).  An understanding of basic digital design:  Boolean algebra, Kmaps, gates and flip flops, finite state machine design.  Linear algebra and calculus at the level of a junior or senior in engineering.

Did you know that one glass of milk provides a 5-year old child with 21% of his\/her daily protein requirements and 8% of their energy needs?\n\nMost milk in the world, about 85%, is produced from cattle. However, water buffaloes, goats, sheep, and camel are also dairy animals. The United States, India, the European Union, Brazil, and New Zealand are among the largest dairy producers in the world. Yet among these dairy-producing countries there are varied methods to generate milk with highly variable productivity and efficiency. Dairy production is vital for the survival of billions of people. Globally, around 150 million small-scale dairy households, equivalent to 750 million people, are engaged in milk production. The number and size of dairy farms varies among countries, but in India alone, there are estimated 78 million dairy farms! In the United States, one of the leading milk-producing countries in the world, total milk production has been steadily increasing in the last decades, reaching over 205 billion pounds (93 billion kilograms) in 2014. This was accompanied by a steady increase in average milk yield per cow, reaching 22,260 lb (over 10,100 kg) per lactation in 2014. How has this efficiency been achieved? What methods are necessary to ensure production of high quality milk? How do we balance milk production efficiency with animal health and environmental protection? This course will provide the student with information to better understand dairy production systems and their role in feeding the world population.\n\nIn this MOOOOO-C, you will learn about the dairy enterprise from internationally recognized dairy science professors who have delivered highly regarded dairy education programs within the United States and internationally.\n\nCourse lectures are translated into Portuguese and Chinese; PDF files of these translations can be found under each course week. The Dairy MOOC team thanks Dr. Antonio Branco (Universidade Estadual de Maring\u00e1, Brazil) and Ms. Yuanyuan Zhang (Pennsylvania State University) for translating the lecture materials.\n\nCourse Sponsors\n\nThis course was supported by the generous contributions of Innovation Center for US Dairy at Silver Level and Pancosma North America, RP Nutrients, Inc. and Arm and Hammer, which provided funding support at a Bronze Level.

We explore the world of cats and dogs and how our relationships with them vary around the world and have changed over time. We ask if we can really know what our animals are thinking or trying to communicate through their facial expressions and behaviours.  \n\nFrom our beloved pets to street dogs, shelter dogs\/cats and welfare challenges, we explore the world from their perspective and examine how their genetic make-up may influence their behavioural responses and choices. We dispel common behavioural myths by looking through a scientific lens, asking questions about the function and development of their behaviour.. We explore how their senses help them to interact with their world and how they communicate with each other and us!\n\nFinally, we ask whether we impose unrealistic expectations on our cats and dogs and how this affects their ability to live alongside us.

For example, an orange juice commercial may promote the health benefits of orange juice but it also is likely to show the product in its context of use at breakfast.  The imagery in the ad will lay out who does the serving, who cooks the breakfast, who gets to sit and be served, what a family should look like, and so on.  Through analysis of these secondary messages, we come to learn that advertising instills ideas about gender, race, social class, and sexuality.

The course provides cellular-level understanding of how sleep deprivation, jet lag, and substances such as alcohol, ,caffeine, and nicotine alter sleep and wakefulness. The second section of the course covers sleep-dependent changes in physiology and sleep disorders medicine. Particular emphasis will be placed on disorders of excessive sleepiness, insomnia, and sleep-dependent changes in autonomic control. Chronic sleep deprivation impairs immune function and may promote obesity. Deaths due to all causes are most frequent between 4:00 and 6:00 a.m., and this second section of the class highlights the relevance of sleep for preventive medicine. The societal relevance of sleep will be considered in the final section of the class.

Drawing on decades of scientific research, you will learn what the most successful people do differently than others, why IQ is not the most significant predictor of success (and can sometimes backfire), and why many commonly held beliefs hold people back from achieving their goals.Although this course is based on the science of success, you will learn many practical ideas that you can apply to your own life immediately, particularly in three main areas:\n\n\u2022\tGetting better results at work (and school) \n\u2022\tAchieving career success (however you define success) \n\u2022\tEnjoying a meaningful, happy, and healthy life\n\nBy the time you finish this course you will know more than most people know about what predicts success in life. One of the most important lessons you\u2019ll learn is that success is earned day-by-day through small wins - small, achievable actions that together can help you achieve your goals sooner and exceed even your own expectations. Therefore, you will have an opportunity to complete a detailed action plan through which you can turn what you learned into specific steps for achieving your most treasured life goals.","instructors":[{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/instructor\/~2375511","learners":"107,819","courses":"2","rate":"4.82\/5","rate_count":"325","name":"Paula Caproni"}],"language":"English"},"thermodynamics-intro":{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/thermodynamics-intro","skill_gain":["Energy","Energy Systems","Mechanical Engineering","Energy Analysis"],"syl_small":[[["Week 1","2 hours to complete","In this module, we frame the context of energy and power supply and demand around the world.

Doing so will, however, require a strong focus on transforming the global food system."]]],"about":"The UN predicts we will be 9-10 billion people on Earth in 2050. Providing so many people with nutritious foods is a massive challenge and one that cannot be met by simply upscaling current practices regarding food production and consumption. Providing humanity with nutritional food is at the center of all decisions related to sustainable development.Agriculture is responsible for 80% of global deforestation. The food systems release 29% of global greenhouse gasses. We use an area equivalent to North and South America combined for the production of meat for consumption or to produce the food necessary to feed the animals we eat. 70% of fresh water use is related to agriculture. These figures are staggering, and they show us, that we need to rethink and transform the way we produce, distribute and consume food worldwide.\n\nThis course focuses on how food systems can become more sustainable. It consists of four modules where each focuses on an essential ingredient towards developing more sustainable food systems: (1) Boosting the small, (2) Transforming the big, (3) Losing less and (4) Eating smarter. In each of these key areas, we will meet people from different countries around the world, who labor every day to find and spread solutions that work.\n\nConnecting the challenges that must be overcome to develop a sustainable global food system with the solutions being developed by the amazing group of people you meet in this course has been a huge source of inspiration for me.

You needn't even bother to reach out and touch someone. If you live, if you're homeothermic biomass, you will be reached and touched.

And, oh, how they love the global village.\u201d Indeed, the same forces of globalization that have lowered barriers to global communication, travel, and commerce have amplified the ability for infectious diseases to spread internationally.

With eight different faculties and numerous research centers and specialized institutes, Lund is the strongest research university in Sweden and one of Scandinavia's largest institutions for education and research. The university annually attracts a large number of international students and offers a wide range of courses and programmes taught in English. \n\nThe Faulty of Law is one of Lund University\u2019s four original faculties, dating back to 1666. It is a modern faculty with an international profile, welcoming both international and Swedish students. Education, research and interaction with the surrounding community are the main focus of the Faculty\u2019s work. The connection between the three is particularly apparent in the programmes and courses offered by the university, including the university\u2019s MOOC course in European Business Law. The students get the chance to engross themselves in traditional legal studies, while interacting with both researchers and professionally active lawyers with qualifications and experience from various areas of law.\nThe faculty offers three international Masters: two 2-year Master\u2019s programmes in International Human Rights Law and European Business Law, and a 1-year Master\u2019s in European and International Tax Law. Students from around 40 countries take part in the programmes which offer a unique subject specialization within each field, with highly qualified researchers and professional legal practitioners engaged in the teaching. \n\nThe Master\u2019s programme in European Business Law provides an in-depth understanding of both the practical and the theoretical aspects of business law within the European Union. The programme provides both general and specific knowledge of the European Union legal framework, which is necessary for students intending to work as legal advisors or business decision-makers. The programme is delivered in English and is open to students with at least a three year degree in Law (Bachelor, LL.B, or equivalent) who want to specialise in European economic and business law.\nThe MOOC course in European Business Law is a great course to start with for students intending to apply for the Master\u2019s programme in European Business Law.

Then, we will investigate red flags for two different forms of revenue manipulation. Manipulating earnings through aggressive revenue recognition practices is the most common reason that companies get in trouble with government regulators for their accounting practices. Next, we will discuss red flags for manipulating earnings through aggressive expense recognition practices, which is the second most common reason that companies get in trouble for their accounting practices. By the end of this module, you\u2019ll know how to spot earnings management and get a more accurate picture of earnings, so that you\u2019ll be able to catch some bad guys in finance reporting!"]],[["Big Data and Prediction Models","2 hours to complete","This week, we\u2019ll use big data approaches to try to detect earnings management. Specifically, we're going to use prediction models to try to predict how the financial statements would look if there were no manipulation by the manager. First, we\u2019ll look at Discretionary Accruals Models, which try to model the non-cash portion of earnings or \"accruals,\" where managers are making estimates to calculate revenues or expenses. Next, we'll talk about Discretionary Expenditure Models, which try to model the cash portion of earnings. Then we'll look at Fraud Prediction Models, which try to directly predict what types of companies are likely to commit frauds. Finally, we\u2019ll explore something called Benford's Law, which examines the frequency with which certain numbers appear. If certain numbers appear more often than dictated by Benford's Law, it's an indication that the financial statements were potentially manipulated. These models represent the state of the art right now, and are what academics use to try to detect and predict earnings management. By the end of this module, you'll have a very strong tool kit that will help you try to detect financial statements that may have been manipulated by managers."]],[["Linking Non-financial Metrics to Financial Performance","2 hours to complete","Linking non-financial metrics to financial performance is one of the most important things we do as managers, and also one of the most difficult. We need to forecast future financial performance, but we have to take non-financial actions to influence it. And we must be able to accurately predict the ultimate impact on financial performance of improving non-financial dimensions. In this module, we\u2019ll examine how to uncover which non-financial performance measures predict financial results through asking fundamental questions, such as: of the hundreds of non-financial measures, which are the key drivers of financial success? How do you rank or weight non-financial measures which don\u2019t share a common denominator?  What performance targets are desirable? Finally, we\u2019ll look at some comprehensive examples of how companies have used accounting analytics to show how investments in non-financial dimensions pay off in the future, and finish with some important organizational issues that commonly arise using these models. By the end of this module, you\u2019ll know how predictive analytics can be used to determine what you should be measuring, how to weight very, very different performance measures when trying to analyze potential financial results, how to make trade-offs between short-term and long-term objectives, and how to set performance targets for optimal financial performance."]]],"about":"Accounting Analytics explores how financial statement data and non-financial metrics can be linked to financial performance. \u00a0In this course, taught by Wharton\u2019s acclaimed accounting professors, you\u2019ll learn how data is used to assess what drives financial performance and to forecast future financial scenarios. While many accounting and financial organizations deliver data, accounting analytics deploys that data to deliver insight, and this course will explore the many areas in which accounting data provides insight into other business areas including consumer behavior predictions, corporate strategy, risk management, optimization, and more. By the end of this course, you\u2019ll understand how financial data and non-financial data interact to forecast events, optimize operations, and determine strategy. This course has been designed to help you make better business decisions about the emerging roles of accounting analytics, so that you can apply what you\u2019ve learned to make your own business decisions and create strategy using financial data.\u00a0","instructors":[{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/instructor\/~1937011","learners":"310,549","courses":"5","rate":"4.75\/5","rate_count":"98","name":"Brian J Bushee"},{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/instructor\/~14757138","learners":"98,735","courses":"2","rate":"4.75\/5","rate_count":"98","name":"Christopher D.

Accounting was created to fulfill this need.  In this module we will explore how accounting was designed to meet the needs of decision makers and what this means to you as a user of accounting information.  We will discuss the concept behind accrual accounting including introducing the two primary accrual accounting financial statements - the balance sheet and income statement.  This module will discuss the purpose and goal of those financial statements, but we will save your experience in creating those statements until module two.  In lesson two of this module, we will explore some basic bookkeeping tools that will get you ready to create a set of financial statements.  The material in this module is likely to take less than a week, but we will make up for it in module two."]],[["The Accounting Cycle and Bookkeeping: Foundational Tools for a Deeper Understanding","5 hours to complete","In this module we will create a set of accrual accounting financial statements.  We will use that experience to walk you through the accounting cycle - which is the process by which accounting captures and aggregates all of the transactions in the period into a set of financial statements.  We will examine each step in the accounting cycle using a comprehensive example of a start up wholesale book retailer.  You will learn how the steps combine to create the statements.  In addition to the comprehensive example we will do together, there will be plenty of chances to practice each step yourself.  This module ends with a chance for you to build your own set of financial statements for a start up company.  Fair warning: in my opinion this is the least exciting material covered in any accounting class (including this one).  It is the basic bookkeeping process, not the interesting part of building an understanding of the business.  But just as you need to learn basic addition and subtraction before you can master the math to design a beautiful building, you also need to learn basic bookkeeping as a foundation for the more interesting accounting.    "]],[["Revenue, Accounts Receivable, Inventory and Cost of Goods Sold","3 hours to complete","In the last module we took an overview perspective to get a sense of the structure of financial statements.  For the next three modules we are going to delve into the details of specific items on the accrual financial statements.  We will work through the most common items on the balance sheet and income statement to develop an understanding of those items.  While we will consider specific items, we will also be building a thought process that we can apply to any future accounting items - even if they are topics that we do not cover in this course.  That will allow you to confidently use accounting for years to come, regardless of changes in items or in the specific accounting rules.There are two lessons in this module.  The first will cover revenue and the related balance sheet item of accounts receivable.  The second lesson will cover costs of goods sold and inventory.  We will cover the conceptual economics of each, discuss the current accounting rules and end with a video that applies our bookkeeping tools.  The readings for each lesson provide more details."]],[["Long-Lived Assets","4 hours to complete","As firms operate, they often use long-lived assets to execute their business models.  Some of these assets are tangible, such as factories or computers.  Others are intangible, such as trademarks and brands.  In either case, managers face the issue of determining how much of these items were used in each period as well as the related question of how much remains.  In this module, we will examine the economics of such transactions as well how accountants reflect them on financial statements.  This module will also cover the most nebulous of intangible assets - goodwill."]],[["Liabilities and Stockholders Equity","3 hours to complete","In the last two modules we have been exploring assets and their impact on both the balance sheet and income statement.  In this module we will turn to discussing the other two components of the balance sheet: liabilities and owners equity.As firms operate, they make promise to deliver value to other entities.  Accountants call these promises liabilities.  You have already seen some liabilities as we discussed assets - after all, you get many assets by promising to give up future value.  We will review those liabilities here as well as introducing a few new ones.  Firms also have owners.  Those owners sometimes directly provide capital and other times let managers retain capital generated by firm operations.  Combined, those two sources of capital represent owners equity.  We will discuss interaction with owners and how they impact our firms economic situation.  We will also discuss how the accounting statements reflect these interactions."]],[["Cash Flow Statements","3 hours to complete","We have been spending our time developing the concepts of accrual accounting.  We started with the big picture, learned how to use bookkeeping to construct accrual statements and then spent the last three modules deep diving into various accrual accounting topics that help to create a useful set of financial statements.  Throughout that time we have focused on capturing economics, not just cash flow.  Of course, many of you still want to know about cash (so do I - it is important).  But I have put off the cash flow statement for two reasons.  First, I wanted you to really give accrual accounting a chance.  If we mix cash in from the beginning, most students seem to drift back to cash every time things get a little complicated.  But we have demonstrated that often leads to misinformed choices.  Second, the cash flow statement effectively requires you to \"undo\" accrual accounting.  That means you have to know accrual accounting pretty well to do a cash flow statement.\nI am going to be honest (I have all along, after all).  The cash flow statement is tough.  It seems like it should be really straight forward.  Parts of it are.  But a few choices were made when the cash flow statement rules were set.  The choices make sense (well, somewhat), but they also make cash flow statements hard.  We will break it down into pieces to make it approachable, but it is my experience that people need to see this multiple times.  Lucky for you, the videos can be watched as often as you want. \nIn this module I will systematically walk you through how cash flow statements are constructed.  We  will start with a cash T account and build statements from there.  Our goal is to build an understanding of what information you can take from a cash flow statement.  We are going to spend an entire week just on the cash flow statement.  At the end of that week, I will expect you can understand an overall statement, but I will not expect you to be able to build one from scratch.  Finally, I want to point out that this module is an inflection point in the course.  We started looking at the idea of financial statements and creating broad statements in modules one and two.  In modules three through five we began to look at the financial statements one item at a time.  With this module we are moving back to the overall statement level, which is the perspective we will also take next module (which will be our last)."]],[["Ratios and Course End Assessment","5 hours to complete","We have covered a lot of ground.  You now are familiar with financial statements and the underlying transactions that create them.  Our goal is to help you use accounting to make decisions and you have surely gotten much better at that.  Now we get the big payoff - we learn how to build ratios to provide insights regarding the decisions we are making (maybe even to help us decide what types of decisions we should consider).  We have seen a few ratios as we went through the course, but in this module we are going to discuss how to go about making your own ratios related to whatever question you want to answer.  I think you will be surprised to find how easy it is now that you understand accounting.  In fact, it is so easy that it will be just a couple of short lessons.  Along with those short lessons, the rest of the week can be used to prepare for and take the final comprehensive exam.  It will go back over material from each module to assure that you can pull it all together."]]],"about":"Through this course, you will start by addressing the two \u201cbig questions\u201d of accounting: \u201cWhat do I have?\u201d and \u201cHow did I do over time?\u201d You will see how the two key financial statements \u2013 the balance sheet and the income statement - are designed to answer these questions and then move on to consider how individual transactions aggregate to make up these financial statements. After developing a broad understanding of accounting and financial statements, you will begin to develop a more nuanced understanding of individual components of doing business, such as making a sale or building inventory.  By considering many of the more common actions of a company, you will build your understanding of accounting, and explore these concepts by applying them across various types of transactions. Once you understand these individual concepts better, you will be ready to return to the overall financial statements and use them as informational tools, including building ratios.You can do this course standalone or to qualify for the residential component of the Finance for Strategic Decision-Making Executive Education program.

First, through the Weller case we will demonstrate the DNA findings providing information towards the source of the DNA may not be at the core of the issue in the case. More and more the source of the DNA is not challenged, but how the DNA got there is."]],[["Week 3 - DNA is not the magic bullet","4 hours to complete","Based on international cases (Knox, Jama, Anderson and Scott) we will illustrate the potentials aspects that one needs to consider when assessing the value of DNA found in small quantity. You will be shown how one performs DNA analysis and what type of results can be produced. We will apply the ENFSI and the ISFG guidelines for evaluative reporting in the case at hand and see if the principles advocated allow avoiding misleading evidence.  We will compare the situations where large quantities of blood are found to cases where low template DNA is recovered. You will learn to contrast these two situations and discover what type of results can be expected and what methods allow a balanced and robust interpretation. This first part of the course will demonstrate that very sensitive techniques require robust interpretation methods. In the second part of the course, you will understand that with trace quantities, stringent control procedures are needed on the crime scene and in the laboratory. Indeed, pollution (or so-called contamination) is an aspect one needs to take into account. Cases (for example in Australia, the USA and England) have shown that the traces from the crime scene can be polluted at the hospital, by paramedics or in the laboratory. It is thus essential to consider this possibility, especially when DNA is the central (and only) element supporting the allegation of a person\u2019s involvement in a crime. How to take into consideration the possibility of error\/contamination when assessing the results will be presented."]],[["Week 4 - Trials by Numbers or Numbers on Trial","2 hours to complete","This week will be dedicated to how forensic scientists should convey the value of their results. From our white room dedicated to photography, we will study famous cases - including the Dreyfus case- and see how statistics can be misused. It will allow us to discuss how statistical values ought to be presented in court. A statistician (Phil Dawid) and a legal scholar (David Kaye) will be interviewed. The second essential topic we will present will be on fallacious reasoning, and in particular on what has been coined, more than thirty years ago, the prosecutors fallacy. Bill Thompson, the first to have described this fallacious argument used in court will be another of our guest interviewees."]],[["Week 5: The wonderland of certainty","4 hours to complete","This week will be present the Dallagher case involving earprints, the Mayfield and the McKie cases involving fingerprints. We want to make you understand what is at stake when an expert decides to conclude to an identification. You will understand through this week that identification is not the duty of the forensic scientist and that it is a decision that must be taken by the Court. We also want to highlight the possible causes for wrong identification. And yes they do occur, even with fingerprints! We will have the privilege to listen to interviews of persons closely involved in these cases: The father of Shirley McKie as well as Brandon Mayfield and her daughter Sharia. "]]],"about":"The aim of this course is to promote critical thinking with regard to forensic science. Today, in general, most people are dazzled by the technical possibilities offered by forensic science. They somewhat live in the illusion that forensic evidence is fool proof and brings factual findings with 100% certainty. This course \u2013 given by specialists in the field \u2013 goes beyond the conventional image that is promoted through TV series such as CSI. It alerts (without alarming) the public on the limits of the techniques in order to promote a sound administration of forensic science in the criminal justice system.\u00a0 It allows participants to understand the importance of probabilistic reasoning in forensic science, because uncertainty is a constitutive part of forensic science. The course is constructed as a series of causes c\u00e9l\u00e8bres that could or have led to miscarriages of justice. Some of these cases have been part of case reviews carried out at the School of Criminal Justice of the University of Lausanne.","instructors":[{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/instructor\/alex-biedermann","learners":"7,384","courses":"2","rate":"4.78\/5","rate_count":"65","name":"Alex Biedermann"},{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/instructor\/franco-taroni","learners":"7,384","courses":"2","rate":"4.78\/5","rate_count":"65","name":"Franco Taroni"},{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/instructor\/christophe-champod","learners":"7,384","courses":"2","rate":"4.78\/5","rate_count":"65","name":"Christophe Champod"},{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/instructor\/tacha-hicks","learners":"7,384","courses":"2","rate":"4.78\/5","rate_count":"65","name":"Tacha Hicks"}],"language":"English"},"actualizacion-manejo-diabetes-tipo-2":{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/actualizacion-manejo-diabetes-tipo-2","skill_gain":[],"syl_small":[[["Importancia del plan de alimentaci\u00f3n y la actividad f\u00edsica en el paciente con diabetes mellitus tipo 2","3 hours to complete","En est\u00e9 modulo, revisar\u00e1s la importancia de que el paciente con diabetes siga un plan de alimentaci\u00f3n y realice actividad f\u00edsica de manera regular."]],[["F\u00e1rmacos utilizados en el manejo del paciente con diabetes mellitus tipo 2 diferentes a la insulina","2 hours to complete","En est\u00e9 m\u00f3dulo, conocer\u00e1s los nuevos f\u00e1rmacos diferentes a la insulina que se utilizan en el manejo del paciente con esta patolog\u00eda y los nuevos f\u00e1rmacos en el tratamiento de la enfermedad, beneficios y contraindicaciones."]],[["Insulinoterapia en el paciente con diabetes mellitus tipo 2","3 hours to complete","En este m\u00f3dulo, estudiar\u00e1s la insulinoterapia, los diferentes tipos de insulina y sus combinaciones, aplicaciones y usos."]],[["Estrategias terap\u00e9uticas en el paciente con diabetes mellitus tipo 2, basadas en la presencia de complicaciones cr\u00f3nicas, comorbilidades y situaciones especiales","3 hours to complete","En est\u00e9 modulo, revisar\u00e1s las complicaciones cr\u00f3nicas de la diabetes, como la nefropat\u00eda, neuropat\u00eda, pie diab\u00e9tico y alteraciones oculares, las cuales deterioran en forma importante la calidad de vida del paciente y generan un mayor costo en los diversos sistemas de salud.

This course is built on the notion that the most exciting writing begins after the first draft. It is specifically for folks who believe that writing poems just to express oneself is like using the Internet just for email. After all, poetry can change the way you and your readers think of the world and its inhabitants; it can break new ground for language; turn a blank sheet of paper into a teeming concert of voices and music.Though any of us may have the potential to make that happen, having an understanding of how several tools of poetic composition can be used (and audaciously \u201cmis-used\u201d) gives you more ways to try (and if we do this right, we might surprise ourselves most of all). \n\nWe'll cover key poetic terms and devices by studying poems by a handful of modern and contemporary poets and then get a chance to try our own hand at writing new poem drafts from a select number of prompts.

No obstante comprender el actual enfoque de Derechos permite orientar la acci\u00f3n hac\u00eda planes y programas que permitan garantizar accesibilidad e inclusi\u00f3n social para personas en situaci\u00f3n de discapacidad.\n\n\nNosotros buscamos promover que la labor social, laboral o profesional se enmarque en los principios y fundamentos del enfoque de Derechos en discapacidad, por lo que los estudiantes que desarrollen este curso desarrollen una mirada cr\u00edtica de las pr\u00e1cticas de apoyo de las personas en situaci\u00f3n de discapacidad. Posterior a 10 a\u00f1os del nacimiento de la Convenci\u00f3n sobre los derechos de las personas con discapacidad, se hace urgente su difusi\u00f3n, comprensi\u00f3n y cr\u00edtica por parte de los ciudadanos a objeto de modificar pr\u00e1cticas que hoy resultan contradictorias, ileg\u00edtimas e innecesarias, las que suelen atentar, en contra de la autonom\u00eda y derechos de las personas con discapacidad.\n\nEl prop\u00f3sito del curso es promover que la labor social, laboral o profesional se enmarque en los principios y fundamentos del enfoque de Derechos en discapacidad. De esta manera los los estudiantes podr\u00e1n reflexionar sobre el enfoque de Derechos consagrado en la Convenci\u00f3n de Naciones Unidas sobre Derechos de las Personas con Discapacidad, las diferencias conceptuales entre modelos, enfoques y teor\u00edas en el \u00e1mbito de la discapacidad en su proceso de tr\u00e1nsito conceptual. De esta manera, los estudiantes analizar\u00e1n distintos \u00e1mbitos de aplicaci\u00f3n de dichos modelos y conceptualizaciones en \u00e1mbitos de salud, educaci\u00f3n y trabajo, comprendiendo una visi\u00f3n integral del desarrollo humano de una sociedad desde el enfoque de derechos humanos.","instructors":[{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/instructor\/abesoain","learners":"14,422","courses":"1","rate":"4.79\/5","rate_count":"24","name":"\u00c1lvaro Besoain"},{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/instructor\/mtamayo","learners":"14,422","courses":"1","rate":"4.79\/5","rate_count":"24","name":"Mauro Tamayo"},{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/instructor\/~43281935","learners":"14,422","courses":"1","rate":"4.79\/5","rate_count":"24","name":"Jame Rebolledo"}],"language":"Spanish"},"data-management":{"link":"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/data-management","skill_gain":["Data Management Plan","Research Data Archiving","Metadata","Data Management"],"syl_small":[[["Understanding Research Data","2 hours to complete","This week introduces multiple types of research data in an array of contexts as well as important data management concepts including metadata and the research data lifecycle.

After completing this course, learners will understand the diversity of data and their management needs across the research data lifecycle, be able to identify the components of good data management plans, and be familiar with best practices for working with data including the organization, documentation, and storage and security of data. Learners will also understand the impetus and importance of archiving and sharing data as well as how to assess the trustworthiness of repositories. Today, an increasing number of funding agencies, journals, and other stakeholders are requiring data producers to share, archive, and plan for the management of their data. In order to respond to these requirements, researchers and information professionals will need the data management and curation knowledge and skills that support the long-term preservation, access, and reuse of data. Effectively managing data can also help optimize research outputs, increase the impact of research, and support open scientific inquiry. After completing this course, learners will be better equipped to manage data throughout the entire research data lifecycle from project planning to the end of the project when data ideally are shared and made available within a trustworthy repository.\n\nThis course was developed by the Curating Research Assets and Data Using Lifecycle Education (CRADLE) Project in collaboration with EDINA at the University of Edinburgh. \n\nThis course was made possible in part by the Institute of Museum and Library Services under award #RE-06-13-0052-13.
